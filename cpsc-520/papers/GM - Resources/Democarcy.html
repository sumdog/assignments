This paper distinguishes between system governance and radical democracy System governance borrows the language of radical democracy while missing its spirit. It advocates increased participation through networks because new institutionalists suggest networks are an efficient means of service delivery. It advocates increased consultation to build <span class="hit">consensus</span> because communitarians suggest <span class="hit">consensus</span> is needed for effective political institutions. System governance is, then, a top-down discourse based on the alleged expertise of social scientists. Radical democrats concentrate instead on the self-government of citizens. Instead of the incorporation of established <span class="hit">groups</span> in networks, they promote a pluralism within which aspects of governance are handed over to associations in civil society. And instead of consultation prior to decision making, they promote a dialogue in which citizens play an active role in making and implementing public policy.<br/>    The concept of governance is widely used to express a range of new practices of public administration. Typically, these practices are associated with a perceived shift from a hierarchical bureaucracy to markets and networks. Historically, bureaucracies have been considered part of a legitimate democratic order because they are subject to control by a legislature that is itself accountable to the electorate. If markets and networks are replacing bureaucracies, however, perhaps we need new means for ensuring that the latter mechanisms remain appropriately democratic; perhaps we even need a new or modified concept of democracy that is better suited to contemporary governance. The transformation in public administration that is captured by the term "governance" raises a series of normative issues about democratic governance.<br/>    Normative questions about good, democratic governance have become vital for public administration from the local to the international level. The World Bank has even added "good governance" to its lending criteria (Williams and Young 1994). It takes good governance to refer primarily to standard liberal democratic practices and norms: representative and responsible government, the rule of law, and an absence of corruption. It also appears to privilege a neoliberal faith in the superiority of market economies and the importance of introducing market mechanisms to the public sector. These neoliberal themes distinguish the World Bank's concept of good governance from those that have recently been invoked as part of a range of centrist and even leftist projects. These latter projects appeal to a system governance that is characterized by a set of overlapping administrative ideas, which mingle the empirical and the normative. The main ideas of system governance include a shift from hierarchies and markets to networks and partnerships, at least within the public sector; the interpenetration of state administration and civil society and of national and international domains; a change in the administrative role of the state, from intervention and control to steering and coordination; a related change in state activity from laws and commands to negotiation and diplomacy; the incorporation of nonstate actors into the policy process; an emphasis on local self-governance; greater levels of public involvement in decision making; and a reliance on more reflexive and responsive modes of public policy. System governance seems to be committed to the ideals of dialogue, participation, <span class="hit">consensus</span>, empowerment, and social inclusion.<br/>    What are we to make of the ubiquitous rise of system governance? Does it mean that local, state, regional, and international regimes are all busily establishing radical democracy? Alternatively, have these regimes adopted the letters of radical democracy while missing its spirit? If we want to plump for the latter view, we might inquire into the spirit they are missing; we might even try to provide an alternative account of radical democracy (Bang 2003).<br/>    This article suggests that system governance fails to capture the promise of radical democracy. It has arisen as an elite project based on expert assertions that it is an efficient and effective mode of governing. The object is to open up a space in which to reclaim the spirit of radical democracy from system governance.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">System Governance</font></b><br/>    Examples of explicit approaches to system governance are increasingly common. They appear within private and voluntary organizations as parts of mission statements and as concerns with corporate governance. They appear within all levels of government, from the local to the state to the regional and global. For example, consider a white paper on European governance published by the Commission of the European Communities at the start of the consultation exercise, begun in 2001. The white paper adopts governance as a normative agenda:<br/></p><blockquote>Reforming governance addresses the question of how the EU uses the powers given by its citizens. It is about how things could and should be done. The goal is to open up policy-making to make it more inclusive and accountable. A better use of powers should connect the EU more closely to its citizens and lead to more effective policies. (CEC 2001, 8)</blockquote><p>    This normative agenda gets unpacked in terms of five principles: openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness, and coherence. These principles then inspire proposals for change under four headings: better involvement in shaping and implementing policy, better policies and better delivery of policies, contributions to global governance, and refocused institutions and policies. The big idea is to expand democratic participation. "The White Paper proposes opening up the policy-making process to get more people and organisations involved in shaping and delivering EU policy" (CEC 2001, 3). This goal of greater participation goes alongside a broad shift in the nature and role of governing institutions from command and control in hierarchies to facilitation and negotiation in networks. "The [European] Union must renew the Community method by following a less top-down approach" (CEC 2001, 4). That is to say, "the linear model of dispensing policies from above must be replaced by a virtuous circle, based on feedback, networks and involvement from policy creation to implementation at all levels" (CEC 2001, 11).<br/>    Although the white paper promotes networks, participation, and inclusion, it does so from what we might describe as a system-governance perspective. The view is that of the political system. The concern is with how to make public policies more effective and more legitimate in the eyes of the public.(FN1) Networks, participation, and inclusion are promoted as means to these specific ends, not as part of a radical democratic project. The white paper opens by suggesting that "political leaders" today need to find effective policy solutions to major problems and overcome popular distrust of governing institutions. Later, when the white paper first mentions democracy and the need to connect institutions to citizens, it does so specifically because "this is the starting condition for more effective and relevant policies" (CEC 2001, 3). Later still, the white paper explains the principle of participation by saying little other than "the quality, relevance and effectiveness of EU policies depend on ensuring wide participation throughout the policy chain--from conception to implementation" (CEC 2001, 10). The impetus behind system governance is not, it seems, a radical democratic commitment; rather, it is the belief that "policies can no longer be effective unless they are prepared, implemented and enforced in a more inclusive way" (CEC 2001, 10).<br/>    System governance derives principally from the beliefs that networks are more efficient than hierarchies and that dialogue and <span class="hit">consensus</span> can build political legitimacy and, thus, effectiveness. These beliefs typically derive, in turn, from broad trends in social science that we might refer to, albeit rather loosely, as the new institutionalism and communitarianism.<br/>    The new institutionalism encourages governance reforms in response to a perceived crisis in an overloaded bureaucracy that is characterized by centralization and vertical integration. Whereas neoliberals argue that we should respond to this crisis through markerization and the New Public Management, new institutionalists promote networks and joined-up governance. The spread of public-choice theory and other approaches rooted in neoclassical economics across the social sciences challenged the widespread commitment to mid-level analysis that concentrated on describing broad institutional and behavioral patterns and producing typologies and correlations between social categories. Although institutionalists generally acknowledge that the policies of the New Right have changed the state, they reject the use of neoclassical economic theory to explain this change. They concentrate instead on mid-level analyses of the rules and structures that, in their view, largely settle what happens at the micro level. The new institutionalism consists of a diverse cluster of attempts to preserve mid-level analysis by emphasizing our social embeddedness and the role of institutions as determinants of social life (Hall and Taylor 1996).<br/>    Whereas neoliberals often deploy assumptions about utility-maximizing agents to postulate that the market is the form of organization, circumstances permitting, that best expresses our rationality, institutionalists often argue that because individuals are embedded in institutions, networks are the organizations best suited to our nature. On one hand, institutionalists use the concept of the network to describe the inevitable nature of all organizations given our embeddedness--hierarchies and markets are networks. The concepts of embeddedness and network suggest that action is always structured by social relationships (Granovetter 1985). Thus, they provide institutionalists with a rebuttal of neoliberal approaches to social science. On the other hand, institutionalists typically suggest that networks are better suited to many tasks than hierarchies or markers. The concepts of embeddedness and network are deployed here to suggest that governance should rely on networks rather than markets, trust rather than competition, and diplomacy rather than the New Public Management (Granovetter 1994; Powell 1990). Institutionalists typically combine these two ways of conceiving networks by suggesting that although all organizations take the form of embedded networks, those that best resemble the ideal type of network reap the benefits of doing so.<br/>    Institutionalists accept neoliberal arguments about the inflexible and unresponsive nature of hierarchies, but instead of promoting markets, they appeal to networks as a suitably flexible and responsive alternative, one that recognizes social actors operate in structured relationships. Institutionalists argue that economic efficiency and success derive from stable relationships characterized by trust, social participation, voluntary associations, and friendship, at least as much as from markets and competition. Although hierarchies can provide a setting for trust and stability, institutionalists often suggest that the time for hierarchies has passed: Hierarchies were useful for the routinized patterns of behavior that dominated Fordist economies, but they are ill suited to delivering the innovation and entrepreneurship that states now have to foster if they are to compete effectively in the knowledge-driven global economy (DeBresson and Amesse 1991; Powell, Kopur and Smith-Doerr 1996). The new economy requires networks in which trust and participation are combined with flexibility, responsiveness, and innovation. Network theory appeals here to its apparent ability to account for what once appeared to be the most prosperous parts of the new economy--Japanese alliance capitalism and the high-tech sectors in Silicon Valley and north-central Italy (Granovetter 1994; Putnam 1993, 160).<br/>    System governance derives in part from the institutionalist idea that networks constitute an effective structure for service delivery and other governmental tasks. This idea suggests that governance will be more effective if it is located in a broad set of overlapping institutions that incorporate diverse sets of actors. The state might enter into partnerships, for example, with private and voluntary <span class="hit">groups</span> within civil society. Hence, proponents of system governance typically advocate increased avenues of participation beyond those associated with representative democracy, precisely to bring into being the multilayered networks they associate with governmental efficiency. They hope that involving actors beyond professional politicians and civil servants will improve the quality of state activity. We might suspect that any proliferation of networks would raise worries about accountability: The resulting complexity obscures who is accountable to whom for what, and there are often few procedures by which to hold accountable the private and voluntary bodies who deliver services (Considine 2002). All too often, proponents of system governance downplay such worries. Sometimes they argue that multilevel or network governance provides alternative avenues for securing democratic legitimacy for actions (Majone 2001).(FN2) At other times, they argue that it can match the democratic credentials of other examples of democratic practice (Moravcsik 2001).(FN3) Even when proponents of system governance do worry about issues of accountability, they typically do so in communitarian terms.<br/>    Communitarianism reproduces the functionalist and corporatist argument that social order depends on the creation of a <span class="hit">consensus</span> over the legitimacy of the political institutions governing it. Functionalists often classify organizations as, say, coercive, remunerative, or normative, according to the main mechanisms by which they maintain social control and the corresponding functions they fulfill for their members.(FN4) In this scheme, coercive organizations have to ensure compliance through force because the people within them tend to resist; remunerative organizations get individuals to conform to their norms by paying them so to do; and normative organizations manufacture suitable conformity out of the feelings of obligation and commonality of their members, who join them to pursue goals they believe to be morally worthwhile. Communitarians draw on such typologies to suggest that democratic states are normative organizations, so they have to create appropriate feelings of obligation and commonality among their citizens if they are to maintain a stable and effective order. This account of the state leads to worries that the democratic deficits associated with governance will damage effectiveness if they prevent citizens from accepting the legitimacy of the political institutions that govern them. Communitarianism thus encourages reforms to address popular perceptions of a democratic deficit within systems of multilevel governance characterized by networks.<br/>    System governance derives in part from the communitarian idea that the effectiveness of political institutions depends on the incorporation of stakeholders within decision-making processes so as to secure a social <span class="hit">consensus</span> over values, policies, and the legitimacy of the institutions themselves. Hence, proponents of system governance typically advocate increased avenues of participation, beyond those associated with representative democracy, to incorporate stakeholders within the policy process and thereby foster the <span class="hit">consensus</span> they associate with an effective and stable order. They worry that declining rates of participation undermine the quality and legitimacy of elite decisions and political institutions. They hope that consulting actors beyond professional politicians and civil servants will make elite policies more acceptable to those whom they target. System governance thus approaches participation from a top-down concern with political authorities securing <span class="hit">consensus</span> and legitimacy for their policies. It is dominated by the imperative of preserving established elites and institutions from the vulnerabilities associated with poor performance.<br/>    The top-down orientation of system governance appears in two of its most significant features. First, system governance offers an almost neocorporatist type of incorporation rather than a more open form of pluralism. It aims almost wholly for the involvement of organized <span class="hit">groups</span> or stakeholders, and it lets the state determine which <span class="hit">groups</span> are involved. The European white paper refers, for example, to "interested parties" and "stakeholders" while leaving it to established political institutions to decide which <span class="hit">groups</span> to include under such headings (CEC 2001, 15).<br/>    Second, system governance restricts participation to consultation rather than a more active dialogue. Even <span class="hit">groups</span> that the state recognizes as stakeholders or partners are invoked only as vehicles for the delivery of services or as having the right to be consulted in decision making; they are not themselves given decision-making powers. Although the European white paper pays lip service to participation at all stages of the policy chain, for example, its proposals apply only to the agenda-setting phase, with decision making left wholly, in accord with the European Community method, to the Council and Parliament.<br/>    This paper asserts that system governance is, for all its talk of inclusion and participation, primarily about securing <span class="hit">consensus</span> for policies and delivering them effectively. Its proposals often contain little that would increase participation by ordinary citizens, as opposed to those sectoral <span class="hit">groups</span> that the state recognizes. And sometimes they restrict even these recognized <span class="hit">groups</span> to a consultative role, as opposed to allowing citizens to make and implement policies.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Participatory Democracy</font></b><br/>    The preceding account of system governance is, of course, intended to act as a critique. It presents system governance as a contingent product of new institutionalism and communitarianism rather than an inherently reasonable or neutral set of ideas. It stands in contrast to the view of those adherents of system governance who portray it as having broken with the old ideological dogmas of state and market in favor of a pragmatic stance that focuses on the effectiveness of policy instruments in delivering <span class="hit">consensual</span> ends. It suggests, on the contrary, that system governance disguises a clear bias taken from the new institutional ism and communitarianism. However, although such critique might open up a space for advocating alternatives, it can be properly effective only if it is combined, at least implicitly, with a defense of substantive alternatives. Because we have to act in the world, we cannot renounce our current mode of life, no matter how much we may come to doubt it, unless we conceive of an alternative as preferable. I want to suggest that we can derive alternatives from a radical democratic tradition that emphasizes our creative capacities as agents within practices.<br/>    System governance often follows the new institutionalism in invoking networks as an efficient form of organization, and it often follows communitarianism in invoking <span class="hit">consensus</span> and shared values as the basis of an effective social order. Hence, when it invokes democratic devices, such as participation within networks or dialogue as a means of building <span class="hit">consensus</span>, it generally does so because experts suggest that these devices are the means of promoting efficiency and effectiveness. Insofar as system governance draws on such expertise, it relies on a broadly liberal account of democracy. It depends on an account of democracy as representative government; elected representatives introduce and check policies that are typically designed and implemented by experts, albeit in consultation with stakeholders. Citizens participate through institutionalized processes, notably by voting for parties in periodic elections and by joining structured interest <span class="hit">groups</span>. Democracy is, in this view, largely a matter of constitutional protections for the fixed principles of the right or a universal and natural freedom. It consists principally of the rule of law and popular sovereignty, which have normative value because they treat individuals as free and equal. The practice of democracy involves, in this view, established rules and procedures for aggregating and adjudicating between interests. Consequently, when system governance seeks to extend democracy, it typically concentrates on ensuring that interests are adequately represented in political institutions, that elite decision makers have adequate information, and that these institutions and elites are accountable to elected representatives and, thus, to citizens.<br/>    Radical democrats have historically rejected the idea of universal or natural freedom. They have drawn on a republican notion of freedom as inherently embedded in particular practices.(FN5) Many liberal democratic norms arose as attempts to protect an illusionary autonomy that supposedly exists outside of social practices. A radical perspective suggests, in contrast, that we might be more concerned with the ways in which people actively make their own freedom through their participation in self-governing practices. This radical perspective implies that participation is a kind of good in itself. The virtue of democracy lies as much in a way of life or a type of experience as it does in a set of institutional arrangements. Radical democracy is, in other words, an attempt to enable people to rule themselves.<br/>    A radical or participatory democracy would treat its members as agents who are capable of deliberating on any prescribed set of values as they conduct themselves within practices defined by their activity. Because people always exist against a social background, we cannot isolate their reasoning from social pressures. The crucial question is, rather, about the nature of these pressures: Are they examples of violence or deliberation? Violence arises, in this contrast, whenever an individual or <span class="hit">group</span> denies the agency of another. The powerful issue of laws or commands, and any failure to comply with them, can result in punishment. The subject of the law or command is treated as an object to be compelled to act in a certain way by the threat of force. Deliberation appears, in contrast, when we treat others as agents whom we might convince of the rightness of acting in a certain way so that they choose to do so. Not all forms of communication constitute deliberation because bribes, threats, and the like do not attempt to convince others through an appeal to reason. Equally, deliberation need not presuppose a prior commitment to reasonableness or to seeking a <span class="hit">consensus</span> because we can treat others as agents even in the absence of such commitments. Deliberation takes the form of continuous persuasion and debate. The process of debate induces people to reflect on their beliefs and preferences, possibly altering them in light of what others say and thereby exercising their agency and their capacity for local reasoning so as to consider what ideals and policies they are willing to endorse. What matters, we might say, is less the gaining of consent by the state than the capacity of citizens to consider and voice differing perspectives in debate. Although a participatory democracy surely would include some violence, we might attempt to strengthen deliberation in place of the violence that currently lurks in the coercive power of the state and the financial power of the market.<br/>    This emphasis on deliberation over violence points toward a similar emphasis on ethical conduct rather than prescriptive rules. Rules are, in this contrast, proclamations that purport to define how others should or should not act; they are typically external to the actor, and they are given prior to the action. Ethical conduct arises when the actor interprets, modifies, or even challenges a looser, flexible, more open-ended set of norms (Foucault 1988). Whereas moral rules seek to impose requirements and restrictions on people, an ethic constitutes a practice in which people negotiate their own relationship to just such requirements and restrictions. No doubt a participatory democracy has to include some moral rules, including those that set out (at least provisionally) the constitutional framework for deliberation. Even so, a participatory democracy might seek to ensure that these rules remain flexible enough to leave plenty of room for individuals to devise new forms of ethical conduct and even to bring the rules themselves into question at regular intervals.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Pluralism against Incorporation</font></b><br/>    A radical perspective raises suspicions about the suspension of democratic decision making that so often accompanies ideal constitutions or theories of justice.(FN6) It is worth inquiring, however, what a participatory democracy that foregrounds deliberation and conduct might look like. There are, of course, several ways of approaching this inquiry. One approach is to reflect on the nature of the citizenship required for such a democracy. It seems probable that such a democracy requires a more active practice of citizenship that those with which we are most familiar with today. If it does, then we will need to reflect on how we might promote such an active citizenship, especially if we are bound to do so within the context of a democratic practice that does little to encourage such activity outside of periodic elections. Because these matters of citizenship are peculiarly pertinent to those of us who hold on to a republican notion of freedom, it should come as little surprise to find that there have been a number of studies exploring them (Cooper 1991).(FN7) Clearly, however, reflections on active citizenship need to be supplemented with studies of the institutions or practices within which we would like citizens to play a more active role, and it is through such reflections that this paper explores the nature of a participatory democracy that foregrounds deliberation and conduct.<br/>    Few participatory democrats want to repudiate liberal rights and liberties as opposed to supplementing them. In their view, freedom is not only abstract rights and liberties under the rule of law; it is, at least as importantly, concrete practices in particular circumstances. To begin, though, we might endorse many of the features of liberal democracy. Democracy relies on rights to protect deliberation and conduct; it requires rights of privacy, free speech, and association, as well as the right to vote. These rights do not just protect individual difference; they also safeguard public and private spaces for deliberation and conduct. To such rights, we might add other principles that also facilitate these things, including a free press, open government, and independent courts of law. Democracy similarly relies on devices to bring deliberation and conduct to bear on our processes of collective decision making, and some of these mechanisms are widespread in liberal democracies, including elected legislatures, public hearings, and procedures for appeal and redress. Although participatory democrats might endorse all of these aspects of liberal democracy, they would do so as part of an account of a practice of freedom. This practice, then, might depart from other aspects of liberal democracy.<br/>    We might argue that a suitable practice of freedom requires that citizens can debate and remake even these liberal rights and mechanisms; it requires that we adopt other rights and devices to extend democracy to other areas of our community; and it requires that we disperse state authority, handing aspects of governance over to other associations.<br/>    To begin, we might seek to locate liberal rights and mechanisms in a democratic practice. Democracy does not stand, in this view, as a universally rational order based on a neutral reason or the allegedly given fact of individual autonomy. It is a historical and mutable construct that we can defend and debate only by using our particular, contingent set of concepts. Even the rights and devices of liberal democracy are legitimate targets for evaluation and critique. When we elucidate or enact a vision of democracy, we arc not laying down given maxims so much as interpreting a historical set of intersubjective concepts and practices.<br/>    Once we take democracy to be historically contingent in this way, we open up the possibility of adding to the rights and devices of liberal democracy others that have a more socioeconomic focus. A historically contingent account of democracy implies that rights are social, not natural. Because we cannot make sense of the idea of an individual coming before the community, we also cannot make sense of the idea of natural or presocial rights. Because individuals exist only within social contexts, they can bear rights only against a social background; consequently, all rights are social in that a society grants them to individuals because it holds the relevant liberties and powers to be essential to the realization of human potential.<br/>    We postulate rights to protect what we regard as the vital interests of our fellows, such as freedom from certain restraints or access to a minimum level of welfare. Hence, we can place rights associated with social and economic deliberation and conduct on an equal footing with those associated with political deliberation and conduct. Because rights are designed to facilitate the fulfillment of human aspiration, our view of which rights are most important depends on our view of a flourishing society, which might lead us to pay as much attention to the economy as to the state. We might champion certain rights and devices that seek to bring democracy to bear on the socioeconomic sphere. Liberal democrats have favored devices that rely on state intervention to control industry in the interest of social rights; the state has relied on taxation and welfare benefits to ensure rights to education, housing, and a minimum income, and it has relied on forms of intervention to subject economic <span class="hit">groups</span> to the will of representative government. Equally, radical democrats have proposed that we supplement or even supplant these devices and rights with others: They have proposed popular control of the state and organizations in civil society, with worker ownership and participation, consumer organizations, and local bodies all providing ways of extending our democratic practices to economic <span class="hit">groups</span>.<br/>    To promote a participatory democracy that emphasizes deliberation and ethical conduct, we might seek to devolve aspects of governance to associations within civil society. These associations could provide policy makers with information, voice the concerns of their members, and play an active role in devising and implementing a range of policies. A pluralist democracy of this sort might be appealing as a way of improving the effectiveness of public policy. It seems likely, for example, that involving diverse <span class="hit">groups</span> and individuals in the process of policy making would bring more relevant information to bear on the policies and give those affected by policies a greater stake in making them work. A pluralist democracy also might be appealing, however, as a way of fostering opportunities for participation, deliberation, and conduct. If we devolved aspects of governance to <span class="hit">groups</span> in civil society, we would increase the number and range of organizations through which citizens could enter into democratic processes. Citizens could get involved through a diverse cluster of identities and concerns, perhaps as members of a religion or race, as people living in a city or region, as people engaged in some occupation, or as consumers. Associations might act as sites for the development of a civic consciousness that fosters deliberation on policy and participation in its formulation and enactment. What is more, because these associations could be self-governing, they need not be bound tightly by rules laid down by the state. Their members could interpret, develop, and even modify our democratic norms through their own conduct. Associations might act as sites for citizens to exercise their agency so as to enact and remake democratic practices.<br/>    The involvement of <span class="hit">groups</span> in the policy process raises the risk of a self-serving factionalism in tension with popular sovereignty and political equality, as many critics have pointed out. To lessen this risk, we might invoke norms according to which <span class="hit">groups</span> and their members should conduct themselves. No doubt the most important norm would be that individuals should be free to join and leave <span class="hit">groups</span> as they wish. Even <span class="hit">groups</span> that conceive of themselves as being based on objectified identities would have to open themselves up to those who fell outside of the criteria by which they sought to define themselves. More generally, <span class="hit">groups</span> pose less of a threat to political equality if they are organized democratically, so they are neither highly centralized nor too reliant on market mechanisms. <span class="hit">Groups</span> should provide many and varied opportunities for participation, and they should have strong lines of accountability based on indirect and direct representation and even outright ownership. If we made such norms compulsory, or if we specified too many of their details, we would undermine much of the value of <span class="hit">groups</span> as sites of ethical conduct. Nonetheless, even when the state forgoes legislation--and there might be times when legislation is appropriate--it still could deploy administrative codes, taxes, and subsidies to encourage open and democratic <span class="hit">groups</span>.<br/>    Pluralist democracies also run the risk that the most wealthy and powerful <span class="hit">groups</span> will exercise a disproportionate influence on public policy. We might argue that this risk is just as present in all other democratic systems. Even so, we might seek to reduce this risk by invoking norms in relation to which the state should conduct its relations with other <span class="hit">groups</span>. No doubt the most important norms would be general ones of importance in all democracies, including norms that sustain open and accountable government. In addition, however, the state might deploy a range of administrative controls, tax incentives, subsidies, and even legislation to equalize the resources and influence of comparable <span class="hit">groups</span>.<br/>    A participatory democracy might ascribe a role in governance to a wide range of democratic <span class="hit">groups</span> in civil society as well as the state. Because we are dealing with fuzzy boundaries rather than sharp dichotomies, we should not be surprised that this vision finds some echoes in system governance, notably in devolution programs and the use of partnerships between the public sector and the nonprofit and private sectors. However, we also find important contrasts. In general, system governance remains wedded to a liberal insti-tutionalism, albeit with networks as the preferred vehicle for service delivery. In contrast, a pluralist democracy attempts to develop and extend a contingent democratic practice to producers, consumers, and others. So, whereas system governance often privileges a liberal agenda of constitutional and electoral reform, a pluralist vision encourages us to invent and establish yet other arenas in which citizens can deliberate and conduct themselves in relation to the state. Whereas system governance privileges the indirect representation of citizens and the incorporation of organized interests within the institutions of the state, a pluralist democracy seeks to assign aspects of governance to democratic associations other than the state. Similarly, whereas system governance promotes networks in which the state plays an active role, even seeking to regulate and control outcomes, a pluralist democracy hands aspects of governance over to associations other than the state. Whereas system governance adopts networks that aim to deliver services more effectively with little concern for the inner workings of the organizations with which the state cooperates, a pluralist democracy is committed to extending democratic principles to businesses, unions, and other <span class="hit">groups</span> within civil society.<br/>    A pluralist democracy also differs from the communi-tarianism with which system governance complements its liberal institutionalism. System governance often appears to believe that there is--or at least that there ought to be--<span class="hit">consensus</span> on public policy such that the state can acquire legitimacy through consultations designed to foster agreement. A pluralist democracy attempts, in contrast, to embrace the ethical pluralism it postulates as perfectly legitimate. It allows <span class="hit">groups</span> to establish different clusters of responsibilities. It appeals to deliberation and compromise, not to an ideal <span class="hit">consensus</span>, as the means of addressing any tensions between the responsibilities established by different <span class="hit">groups</span>. So, whereas system governance emphasizes the importance of consulting people, democratic pluralism concentrates on giving them opportunities to remake their collective practices without requiring them to do so in any given way. Whereas system governance implies that the goal of consultation is <span class="hit">consensus</span>, democratic pluralism focuses on the processes of decision making without postulating a substantive concept of the common good against which outcomes might be measured. Whereas system governance implies that people must reach a <span class="hit">consensus</span> if we are to have an integrated society, democratic pluralism relies on deliberation and compromise to resolve differences among individuals and <span class="hit">groups</span> and to establish a more "decentered" social order.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Dialogue against Consultation</font></b><br/>    We have seen that radical democrats can defend an open community in which freedom consists of agency within particular practices that are associated with the possibilities of participation, deliberation, and ethical conduct rather than the protection of a spurious autonomy. We have also seen that they can promote these possibilities by means of pluralism, in which aspects of governance are transferred from the state to other democratic associations. Even if we decentered the state by giving such a role to other <span class="hit">groups</span>, however, we would do well to ask, what spaces do the state and these other <span class="hit">groups</span> offer for participation, deliberation, and conduct? To begin, we again might endorse many features of liberal democracy. Here, too, liberal rights and devices safeguard private and public spaces for participation, deliberation, and conduct. They also help to bring deliberation and conduct to bear on the processes of collective decision making. Democracy benefits from the rights to free speech and suffrage and from devices such as elected legislatures and the rule of law. In particular, we might endorse the emphasis on elected legislatures acting as vehicles of popular sovereignty to direct and oversee administrative agencies, although if we are pluralists, we will favor a wide diversity of such legislative bodies. No matter how much we invoke deliberation and conduct, there will be moments when decisions have to be made, and at those moments, majority rule through the legislature would seem to be an appropriate way of closing discussion and making a collective judgment. Similarly, no matter how many avenues for participation we establish in administrative agencies, complex modern societies appear to require a division of labor between the legislative bodies that make laws and the agencies that implement them.(FN8) Any such division of labor seems to require, in turn, that the legislatures constrain and oversee the agencies: Democracy would be a sham if administrative acts were not accountable to the legislative bodies that authorize them. Even when we imagine rights and devices to extend deliberation and conduct in the formulation and implementation of public policy, we should bear in mind that they are supposed to support, not supplant, existing opportunities for legislative oversight and judicial review.<br/>    The importance of liberal rights and mechanisms does not imply that they are sufficient. On the contrary, a focus on democracy as a practice suggests that they pay insufficient attention to participation, deliberation, and conduct in the stages of collective decision making that come before and after the legislative act. Whereas liberal constitutions often treat people as autonomous beings with incorrigible preferences that merely need to be represented adequately at the moment of legislative decision, a concern with democratic practice conceives of people as agents who construct and modify their preferences and beliefs through deliberation and conduct. Whereas liberal constitutions often distinguish sharply between policy issues and managerial ones, with the latter being left to administrative agencies, a concern with democratic practice suggests that our reasoning typically involves a reflexivity in which we further specify our ends when we choose the means by which to realize them.<br/>    Our democratic practice consists of stages of public debate, legislative decision, and implementation. Proposed laws and policies emerge from public debate before being drafted by legislators who also decide whether to enact them. If enacted, they are then implemented by agencies, which, in the process, typically specify their content even further. The stages of legislation and implementation are subject to various modes of feedback and oversight to keep them subject to popular will as expressed in debate. Each of these stages can be opened up to greater participation, deliberation, and conduct through a variety of rights and devices. So, although elected legislatures are arguably the organizations most open to public influence, and although we might ascribe primacy to them, a concern with democracy as a practice encourages us to devise additional rights and mechanisms to bring democratic values to bear on public debate and policy implementation. When we devise such rights and mechanisms, they will not be fixed principles derived from pure reason but contingent, invented possibilities. Our democratic practices should be-the means by which we decide which inventions we do and do not adopt.<br/>    Once we renounce ideal constitutions designed to protect an alleged autonomy in favor of practices that allow for agency, we free ourselves to invent, modify, and reject rights and procedures during the stages of public debate, legislative decision, and administrative implementation. For the public-debate stage, we might propose modes of deliberation and conduct such as public hearings and deliberative polls. For the legislative-decision stage, we might propose modes of deliberation and conduct such as the citizens' initiative and referendum; we might even suggest that decisions sometimes be made by citizens' juries or deliberative polls, with all citizens having an equal right or opportunity to participate. In general, we might promote more face-to-face forms of debate leading to more direct forms of decision making.<br/>    Although we might propose a range of democratic devices for the debate and decision stages, perhaps our focus should fall on the implementation stage. Many liberal devices cover the debate and decision stages, whereas implementation is often left to the expertise of an unelected civil service. Besides, concerns about governance characteristically stress democratic deficits in the agencies--commissions, departments, public-private partnerships, and others--that are involved in the implementation of public policy. For these reasons, our focus should fall on promotion of a dialogic public policy. As we have seen, democratic principles suggest that agencies should operate in a liberal framework that includes the rule of law and fidelity to legislative decisions. Within this framework, however, we can promote the processes of dialogue that seek to bring popular voices into agencies.<br/>    Here, we can divide the implementation stage into substages, such as publicity, decision, and review. In the publicity substage, agencies could not only make known the rules and decisions on the basis of which they intend to act, but also invite comments on them from citizens and even commission surveys, deliberative polls, and the like to garner opinion on them. During the decision stage, agencies might involve citizens through all sorts of rarely used mechanisms; they could create committees as sites for face-to-face negotiations between agency representatives and citizens, and they could provide citizens with positions on the drafting committees that define their operating rules and procedures. Citizens could help to make decisions and draft rules at all administrative levels, from the central civil service to local offices. In the review stage, the agencies could be accountable not only to the legislature but also directly to citizens; such accountability could be enhanced by such means as reporting to citizen committees and direct election of agency officials.<br/>    Critics argue that dialogic modes of public policy allow particular <span class="hit">groups</span> to dominate or capture agencies. We might argue that this risk is equally present in all other administrative systems. Even so, we might seek to lessen this risk by appealing to norms in relation to which agencies should conduct themselves. No doubt the most important norms would be those associated with publicity and accountability, which enable citizens to monitor and challenge the conduct of agencies. In addition, a norm of openness might preclude agencies from limiting participation in the negotiation and drafting processes, requiring them instead to involve all citizens who make a case that they have an interest in any given issue. Perhaps a diffuse public voice could be added to such committees by introducing a norm of service akin to that which currently operates with respect to juries. Likewise, a norm of fairness might require agencies to offer financial or technical support to <span class="hit">groups</span> or individuals who want to be involved in negotiating or drafting committees but who would be at a disadvantage because of their lack of these resources. Here, too, of course, if we made such norms compulsory or specified their content in too much detail, we would undermine much of the value of agencies as sites of conduct. What matters is that we have a range of administrative codes, procedures, and subsidies that ensure public dialogue remains open and democratic.<br/>    A participatory democracy might make use of a dialogic public policy instead of a reliance on allegedly neutral experts. Although this vision is echoed in communitarian themes that characterize system governance--notably, in the widespread belief that policy should be made in consultation with the relevant stakeholders--there are also important differences here. Whereas system governance typically privileges liberal democracy, in which public policy is implemented by a managerial elite subject to direction and supervision by a political elite, who, in turn, are accountable to the popular will through elections, a dialogic approach would promote deliberation and conduct throughout the policy-making process, including the stage of implementation. Whereas system governance typically relies on the assumption that administration can be a purely neutral or technical matter of implementing the will of the legislature, a dialogic approach allows for popular involvement in the processes by which administrative agencies actively interpret and define the will of the legislature.<br/>    A dialogic approach to public policy also offers a contrast to the way in which system governance, with its debt to an institutionalist approach to networks, often brushes aside democratic values in its rush to promote efficiency, effectiveness, and best value. Institutionalists, who acknowledge that networks have their own typical problems, often try to improve the capacity of the state to manage networks by devising appropriate tools (Kickert, Klijn, and Koppenjan 1998). System governance adopts a technical stance toward the management of networks, even adopting many of the tools advocated by institutionalists. It assumes that the center can devise and impose devices that foster integration within networks and thereby realize its own objectives. Such policies have a centralizing thrust in that they attempt to coordinate departments and local authorities by imposing a new style of management on agencies; they must comply with criteria that are defined by the center. In contrast, a dialogic approach arguably undercuts the idea of a set of tools for managing networks: If networks are constructed differently, contingently, and continuously, we cannot have a tool kit for managing them. Thus, participatory democracy might lead us to forsake alleged techniques of management for a practice of learning by telling stories and listening to them.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Conclusion</font></b><br/>    Governance signifies a widespread perception of a shift in the nature and role of the state, from a monolithic bureaucratic hierarchy toward multilevel institutions that interpenetrate with civil society through markets and networks. It has opened the way to a new theoretical agenda related to this shift. This agenda consists of questions about the concepts we need to describe governance, how we might explain it, and what we should do about it, if anything. Prominent among these questions is, how should we envisage democratic governance? Representative liberal democracy appears to leave a large democratic deficit in many areas of multilevel governance through networks. System governance arose as a way of addressing these deficits, but it is a top-down response that uses the terms of inclusion and participation to refer only to the incorporation of <span class="hit">groups</span> and processes of consultation. Perhaps system governance might be a valuable supplement to representative democracy. However, we should be wary of the stronger claims that are sometimes made on its behalf. It should not be treated as a viable substitute for representative democracy, as if a process of top-down consultation with organized interests were enough to offset the democratic deficits associated with multilevel networks (contrast Majone 2001; Moravcsik 2001). And it certainly should not be mistaken for a radical, participatory democracy that fosters pluralism and dialogue.<br/>    System governance generally consists of attempts to improve the effectiveness of established institutions by means of officially sponsored and managed participation. At best, it blends the tensions between the goals of broadening participation and preserving existing authorities. If it ever succeeded in genuinely broadening participation, it would run up against the possibility that citizens and associations act as catalysts for change, overturning existing norms, practices, and institutions instead of enhancing their legitimacy and effectiveness. Yet system governance typically forecloses this possibility by limiting the form and content of participation. When system governance presents us with initiatives to promote greater participation, they are characteristically defined in terms of the perceived needs of existing elites and institutions. Citizens and associations have to transform themselves in accord with the institutionalist and communitarian agenda of system governance or else they tend to remain excluded from these initiatives.<br/>    Radical democracy, in contrast, attempts to foster pluralism and dialogue in ways that do not require citizens and associations to conform to the perceived needs of existing elites and institutions. No doubt we cannot entirely insulate radical democracy from the problems that beset system governance. Indeed, if we seek to define radical democracy in a way that eschews any attempts at active facilitation from above, we are in danger of falling prey to a kind of defeatist purism, according to which radical democracy is inherently fugitive, transient, or unrealizable because it can neither be specified as a constitution nor sustained as a practice (Wolin 1994). What we can do is highlight a number of aspects of radical democracy that clearly distinguish it from system governance. For example, radical democracy might promote pluralism rather than incorporation and dialogue or consultation.<br/>    Whereas system governance typically incorporates recognized <span class="hit">groups</span> that are thought to represent objectified interests, radical democracy relies primarily on solidarities and networks that operate in everyday life to minimize dependence on established institutions and objectified identities. Our everyday lives are replete with overlapping cultures of consumption as well as work, and these cultures give rise to diverse and changing affiliations, all of which could be resources for citizenship. A radical democracy might include a plurality of self-governing democratic associations based on different solidarities that arise within civil society. This pluralism would encourage politicians and civil servants to engage such associations in dialogue rather than just consult them. More importantly, perhaps, politicians and civil servants who sought to facilitate such a radical democracy would, at a minimum, need to be prepared to let go; they would have to accept that their efforts might lead to results that are radically different from those for which they had hoped. They might even need to confront themselves as sources of pressure for conformity to existing norms and practices. They might have to interrogate and transform their own beliefs and actions within the democratic process. They, too, would be, in this sense, part of a radical democracy in which we made ourselves through our participation in self-governing practices.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">References</font></b><br/>    Bang, Henrik. 2003.

Much the same could be said about many of the academic reports written to advise the commission on governance. Note, most obviously, the very tide of Lebessis and Paterson's working paper (1999).<br/>2. Interestingly, this argument is accompanied by an appeal to the importance of expertise in the relevant state activities, such as regulation (Majone 1996).<br/>3. This argument is accompanied by an insistence on the importance of empirical expertise as a source of knowledge about "real-world" democracy--as opposed to "utopian thinking" about "ideal democratic systems" (Moravcsik 2004).<br/>4. For the development of such classifications within functionalist studies of organizations and their later place in communitarianism, see Etzioni (1961) and Etzioni (1997), respectively. For a recent example of their impact on discussions of governance, see Marintelli (2003).<br/>5. Although the historical recovery of republicanism has perhaps been insensitive to its overlap with liberalism, there is nonetheless an important contrast between the two (Skinner 1998). On the place of republicanism as a background for the emergence of radical democratic projects, see Bevir (2000b). For attempts to restate related ideas as contemporary ethical and political theories, see Petit (1999) and Bevir (2000a).<br/>6. Of course, experiments on what would be agreed upon by free and equal people can inspire democratic proposals (Held 1995), but perhaps the suspicion remains that democracy is suspended when the "expert" tells us what free and equal people would or should decide rather than leaving it to them to so decide.<br/>7. Consider, too, the proliferation of material evidenced by the emergence of whole journals such as Citizemhip Studies, which began in 1999 and is published by Carfax. Of course, radical conceptions of active citizenship can be displaced into a systems perspective that seeks to promote citizenship education primarily to ensure a <span class="hit">consensus</span> on policies and their effective implementation and acceptance.<br/>8. There are, of course, radical conceptions of democracy that reject this distinction between policy making and policy implementation. Although I will seek to rethink how this distinction operates--for example, by emphasizing the degree to which polices are made in their implementation--I see little prospect of its total dissolution, and I am not sure I would want such a dissolution even if it were a viable prospect. For approaches to this distinction, see Stivers (2001).<br/></p></body></html>
