        <b><font size="2" face="Arial">Understanding conflict.</font></b><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>What is conflict?</b><br>
    Conflict is a natural disagreement resulting from individuals or groups that differ in
    attitudes, beliefs, values or needs. It can also originate from past rivalries and
    personality differences. Other causes of conflict include trying to negotiate before the
    timing is right or before needed information is available.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">The ingredients of conflict.</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Needs</em></b> - Needs are things that are essential to our well-being.
    Conflicts arise when we ignore others' needs, our own needs or the group's needs. Be
    careful not to confuse needs with desires (things we would like, but are not essential).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Perceptions</em></b> - People interpret reality differently. They perceive
    differences in the severity, causes and consequences of problems. Misperceptions or
    differing perceptions may come from: self-perceptions, others' perceptions, differing
    perceptions of situations and perceptions of threat.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Power</em></b> - How people define and use power is an important influence on
    the number and types of conflicts that occur. This also influences how conflict is
    managed. Conflicts can arise when people try to make others change their actions or to
    gain an unfair advantage.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Values</em></b> - Values are beliefs or principles we consider to be very
    important. Serious conflicts arise when people hold incompatible values or when values are
    not clear. Conflicts also arise when one party refuses to accept the fact that the other
    party holds something as a value rather than a preference.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Feelings and emotions</em></b> - Many people let their feelings and emotions
    become a major influence over how they deal with conflict. Conflicts can also occur
    because people ignore their own or others' feelings and emotions. Other conflicts occur
    when feelings and emotions differ over a particular issue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Conflict is not always negative. In fact, it can be healthy when effectively managed.
    Healthy conflict can lead to...<br>

    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangle.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> New ways of thinking<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangle.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Additional management options</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the conflict is understood, it can be effectively managed by reaching a consensus
    that meets both the individual's and society's needs. This results in mutual benefits and
    strengthens the relationship. The goal is for all to &quot;win&quot; by having at least
    some of their needs met.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>How public and private conflicts differ.</b><br>
    Most of us have experience with conflict management and negotiation in private disputes
    (with a salesman, among family members or with your employer).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Public conflicts, like those that can occur during watershed management efforts and
    other environmental issues often are rooted in trying to balance environmental protection
    and economic growth and jobs. Keep in mind, however, that effective watershed management
    can result in both economic and environmental benefits. Some complicating factors include:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Distribution of costs and benefits.</em></b> Those who benefit may not be the
    same as those who pay the costs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Perceptions of problems.</em></b> People tend to blame others for causing the
    problem.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Speed of clean-up or other actions.</em></b> Some will want changes to take
    place more quickly than others.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Managing Conflict</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are five steps to managing conflict. These steps are:<br>

    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangleo.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Determine management strategy<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangleo.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Pre-negotiation<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangleo.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Negotiation<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangleo.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Post-negotiation</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Step 1: Analyze the conflict.</b><br>
    The first step in managing conflict is to analyze the nature and type of conflict. To do
    this, you'll find it helpful to ask questions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Answers may come from your own experience, your partners or local media coverage. You
    may want to actually interview some of the groups involved. Additional information
    regarding analyzing conflicts can be found in the Guide to Information and Resources.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Step 2: Determine management strategy.</b><br>
    Once you have a general understanding of the conflict, the groups involved will need to
    analyze and select the most appropriate strategy. In some cases it may be necessary to
    have a neutral facilitator to help move the groups toward consensus.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Conflict Management Strategies</b><br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangley.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Collaboration<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangley.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Compromise<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangley.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Competition<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangley.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Accommodation<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/triangley.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Avoidance</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Collaboration</em></b> - This results from a high concern for your group's own
    interests, matched with a high concern for the interests of other partners. The outcome is
    &quot;win/win.&quot; This strategy is generally used when concerns for others are
    important. It is also generally the best strategy when society's interest is at stake.
    This approach helps build commitment and reduce bad feelings. The drawbacks are that it
    takes time and energy. In addition, some partners may take advantage of the others' trust
    and openness. Generally regarded as the best approach for managing conflict, the objective
    of collaboration is to reach consensus. (See the <a href="/KYW/Brochures/BuildingLocal.html"><em>Building Local Partnerships</em></a> guide
    for more information about consensus.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Compromise</em></b> - This strategy results from a high concern for your group's
    own interests along with a moderate concern for the interests of other partners. The
    outcome is &quot;win some/lose some.&quot; This strategy is generally used to achieve
    temporary solutions, to avoid destructive power struggles or when time pressures exist.
    One drawback is that partners can lose sight of important values and long-term objectives.
    This approach can also distract the partners from the merits of an issue and create a
    cynical climate.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Competition</em></b> - This strategy results from a high concern for your
    group's own interests with less concern for others. The outcome is &quot;win/lose.&quot;
    This strategy includes most attempts at bargaining. It is generally used when basic rights
    are at stake or to set a precedent. However, it can cause the conflict to escalate and
    losers may try to retaliate.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Accommodation</em></b> - This results from a low concern for your group's own
    interests combined with a high concern for the interests of other partners. The outcome is
    &quot;lose/win.&quot; This strategy is generally used when the issue is more important to
    others than to you. It is a &quot;goodwill gesture.&quot; It is also appropriate when you
    recognize that you are wrong.The drawbacks are that your own ideas and concerns don't get
    attention. You may also lose credibility and future influence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Avoidance</em></b> -This results from a low concern for your group's own
    interests coupled with a low concern for the interests of others. The outcome is
    &quot;lose/lose.&quot; This strategy is generally used when the issue is trivial or other
    issues are more pressing. It is also used when confrontation has a high potential for
    damage or more information is needed. The drawbacks are that important decisions may be
    made by default.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Step 3: Pre-negotiation.</b><br>
    To set the stage for effective negotiation, the groundwork must be laid. The following
    should occur prior to negotiation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Initiation</em></b> - One partner raises the possibility of negotiation and
    begins the process. If no one is willing to approach the others to encourage them to reach
    an agreement, a trusted outsider could be brought in as a facilitator.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Assessment</em></b> - Conditions must be right for negotiation to be successful.
    Key players must be identified and invited. Each side must be willing to collaborate with
    the others. Reasonable deadlines and sufficient resources to support the effort must
    exist. Spokespersons for each group must be identified and involved. Parties need to
    determine which issues are negotiable and which are not.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Ground rules and agenda</em></b> - The groups must agree on ground rules for
    communication, negotiation and decision making. They should agree on the objectives of the
    negotiation process. An agenda of issues to be covered needs to be developed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Organization</em></b> - Meeting logistics must be established, including agreed
    upon times and places. People must be contacted and encouraged to attend. Minutes must be
    taken so that information can be distributed before and after meetings.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Joint fact-finding</em></b> - The groups must agree on what information is
    relevant to the conflict. This should include what is known and not known about social and
    technical issues. Agreement is also needed on methods for generating answers to questions.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Step 4: Negotiation.</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Interests</em></b> - When negotiating be sure to openly discuss interests,
    rather than stated positions. Interests include the reasons, needs, concerns and
    motivations underlying positions. Satisfaction of interests should be the common goal.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Options</em></b> - To resolve conflicts, concentrate on inventing options for
    satisfying interests. Do not judge ideas or favor any of the options suggested. Encourage
    creativity, not commitment.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Evaluation</em></b> - Only after the partners have finished listing options,
    should the options be discussed. Determine together which ideas are best for satisfying
    various interests.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Written agreement</em></b> - Document areas of agreement and disagreement to
    ensure common understanding. This helps ensure that agreements can be remembered and
    communicated clearly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Commitment</em></b> - Every partner must be confident that the others will carry
    out their parts of the agreement. Discuss and agree upon methods to ensure partners
    understand and honor their commitments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>When evaluating options...</b><br>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Step 5: Post-negotiation.</b><br>
    Once negotiation is complete, the group will need to implement the decisions made. Some
    key steps include:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Ratification</em></b> - The partners must get support for the agreement from
    organizations that have a role to play in the agreement. These organizations should be
    partners and should have been involved in the previous steps. Each organization will need
    to follow its own procedures to review and adopt the agreement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><em>Implementation</em></b> - You and your partners' jobs are not done when you've
    reached agreement. Communication and collaboration should continue as the agreement is
    carried out. The partnership will need to have a plan to monitor progress, document
    success, resolve problems, renegotiate terms and celebrate success.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Negotiation skills.</b><br>
    Negotiation is an important skill for coming to an agreement when conflicts develop at
    home, at work and when dealing with issues like those related to watershed management.
    When negotiating...</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Separate people from the problem.</b><br>
    When negotiating, remember you're dealing with people who have their own unique needs,
    emotions and perceptions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some conflicts are based on differences in thinking and perceptions. These conflicts
    may exist mainly in peoples' minds. It helps for each party to put themselves into the
    other's shoes so they can understand each other's point of view.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Identify and openly discuss differences in perceptions, being careful not to place
    blame. In addition, recognize and understand the other side's emotions as well as your
    own.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Interest vs. Position </b><br>
    People often confuse interests with positions. An interest may be reducing litter in
    roadside ditches. There are many possible ways of addressing this interest. One might be
    the position of mandatory recycling. Another position might be a deposit on bottles and
    cans. Still another could be organizing a clean-up day.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Focus on interests, not positions.</b><br>
    Focusing on interests, rather than positions, makes it possible to come up with better
    agreements. Even when people stand on opposite positions, they usually have a few shared
    interests.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It takes time and effort to identify interests. Groups may not even be clear about
    their own interests. It helps to write down each group's interests as they are discovered.
    It helps to ask why others take the positions or make the decisions they do. Partners will
    have multiple interests. Interests involving important human needs (such as security,
    economic well-being, a sense of belonging, recognition and control over one's life) are
    difficult to negotiate.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Develop optional solutions.</b><br>
    When developing optional solutions that meet the interests of all sides, try to meet as
    many of each side's interests as possible. Start by inviting all sides to brainstorm ideas
    (before reaching a decision). Brainstorming is discussed in the <a href="/KYW/Brochures/LeadingCom.html"><em>Leading &amp; Communicating</em></a> guide.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Some obstacles to developing innovative options are:</b><br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/trianglep.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Judging and rejecting prematurely<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/trianglep.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Searching for a single best answer<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/trianglep.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Putting limits on scope or vision<br>
    <img src="/gifs/filler.gif" width="15" height="1"><img src="/gifs/trianglep.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="16"> Considering only your own interests</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To overcome these obstacles, view the situation through the eyes of different partners.
    Focus on shared interests to make the process smoother for all involved. Look for
    meaningful opportunities, not simple solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Developing objective criteria.</b><br>
    When developing criteria for selecting or combining possible alternatives, revisit the
    conflicting interests. These can't be ignored or &quot;wished&quot; away. Instead discuss
    them as you begin developing criteria for judging alternatives. Also keep in mind
    principles such as fairness, efficiency and scientific merit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Strive for criteria that are legitimate, practical and unbiased. You may also find it
    helps to explore the criteria used in making past decisions and discuss criteria with your
    partners or outside experts.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>About this guide...</b><br>
    This guide is one of a series for people who want to organize a local partnership to
    protect their watershed. The guides will not solve all your problems. They were designed
    to provide guidance for going through the process of building a voluntary partnership,
    developing a watershed management plan and implementing that plan. Because the
    characteristics of each watershed are unique; you may wish to select and use the portions
    of this guide that are applicable to your particular situation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although the series is written for watershed-based planning areas, the ideas and
    process can be used for developing other types of plans (such as wildlife areas) to match
    the concerns of the partnership. Regardless of the area, remember a long-term, integrated
    perspective - based on a systematic, scientific assessment - can be used to address more
    than one concern at a time.</font></p>
