Aug. 17--When the low bid for a school classroom construction project came in
at nearly double the expected price recently, Phenix City Schools officials
sent the architect back to the drawing board.

Now they hope to get nearly twice as many classrooms for about the same price.

The project called for building six classrooms onto Ridgecrest Elementary
School. The expected cost was $800,000-$900,000, but the low bid from one of
only two bidding companies was $1.7 million, Phenix City Schools
Superintendent Larry DiChiara said.

"Other contractors in the area were swamped," DiChiara told school board
members Tuesday night. "They were going to charge us $175 a square foot. We
looked at the site and asked why it was so expensive. They were going to
charge $200,000 for site preparation because of sloping and other problems."

Alterations

To avoid those site costs, the architect suggested building two stories high
instead of one and leaving first-floor classrooms unfinished, he said. Now
they are waiting to see how much it will cost for the low bidder to do the
revised project. It will require an elevator and a few other changes, but with
the way Ridgecrest is growing, DiChiara said the classrooms will be needed.

The high bid for that project has him concerned about bids for two other
classroom projects the school district will receive bids on Aug. 24, he said.
Bids are expected for classroom projects at Phenix City and Sherwood
elementary schools.

"I'm nervous about the bids," DiChiara said. "The Lakewood Elementary project
came in at $124-$125 per square foot. When we started these projects, we
expected $100 a square foot. But with all the construction going on at Fort
Benning and in the area, contractors are busy. The cost of materials also is
up."

School overcrowding

In other action, the board:

-- Received a report from DiChiara on school enrollment figures after the
first six days of classes. The numbers show that 5,563 students were enrolled
Tuesday. That's 200 more than at the same time last year and a record number
of students in the schools at this time in the year. Central High School is
crowded with 1,417 students, up by 116 students from the first day. Ridgecrest
Elementary is overcrowded at 670 students, up by 41 from day one, and
fourth-grade classes are so full there that school officials are ready to tell
parents of any new students arriving that they will have to attend Meadowlane
Elementary, DiChiara said. The number of students arriving at all city schools
since day one has increased by 486. The numbers could climb until after Labor
Day.

-- Approved DiChiara's recommendation to enter a three-year, lease-to-own
agreement with Dell to buy and replace desktop computers for teachers in all
schools. The amount to be financed is $97,000 for 100 computers at 3.57
percent interest, with annual lease payments of $34,690. Teachers at Central
High have agreed to give up $27,000 of their technology money from the state
to go toward the cost of the computers, which means the school district will
spend only $6,000-$7,000. DiChiara said teachers at other schools are
considering doing the same thing to get old computers replaced faster.

-- Approved DiChiara's recommendation to deed the old Head Start Center
building at 1100 First St. to the city of Phenix City, which may use it for
the Phenix City Housing Authority's maintenance building. The facility is used
only for storage.
