Such an approach implies a combination of practical philosophical considerations and concrete empirical analysis of lived experiences and social processes in concrete <span class="hit">project</span> settings. Two important issues are addressed: the complex process of this kind of qualitative research, and the nature and practical usefulness of its outcomes. First, the interconnected ness of a number of elements in the process of <span class="hit">management</span> research (the focus of inquiry, theoretical <span class="hit">tradition</span> used to define the research question, methodological approach to research design, and data collection and interpretation method) is presented as a holistic framework, which is then used to discuss the implications of deploying interpretative and critical methodologies in researching <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice, skills, and competencies. By providing examples of both the process and outcomes from an illustrative research study, the paper illuminates how the chosen, phronesis-centered approach underpinned by the concepts of "pragmatic epistemology" and "cooperative enquiry" can generate new insights into <span class="hit">project</span> managers' daily coping with the complexity of <span class="hit">projects</span>. Further commentary is then provided on how the mainstream, normative prescriptions regarding individual skills and competencies could be combined with the alternative ones that promote intuition, judgment, and social and political virtuosity in local contexts, and integrated to enhance the existing <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> training and development schemes.<br/>    Keywords: qualitative research; <span class="hit">project</span> managers; pragmatic knowledge; skills development<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Introduction</font></b><br/>    Governed by the aim of broadening our understanding of practical action and managerial conduct in complex <span class="hit">project</span> environments, this paper discusses the conceptual underpinnings of research approaches that can generate such broader insights, and illustrates the key claims with examples from an empirical study. The consideration is given to a combination of two qualitative research approaches--namely, interpretative and critical methodologies--and how their application can be justified and used to create knowledge about the ways in which <span class="hit">project</span> managers cope with the challenges of contemporary <span class="hit">projects</span>. Two important issues will be raised and discussed in the paper: (1) the process of "qualitative research" as an intellectual engagement with a <span class="hit">management</span> phenomenon, and (2) the nature of knowledge created through such a process, including the resulting propositions offered to <span class="hit">project</span> managers regarding their practical action.<br/>    The first part of the paper proposes and discusses an integrative conceptual framework, representing the process of knowledge creation through research, as understood by the author of the paper. It will then be used to explain and discuss the process and outcomes of a research study into knowledge, skills, and competencies of high-performing <span class="hit">project</span> managers. In order to show how the chosen, interpretative critical research approach can broaden our understanding of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice and skills beyond that generated by more conventional and <span class="hit">traditional</span> research approaches in the field, reference will be made to the connection between the specific research methodologies considered in this case and other elements of the research process. These elements include the theoretical concepts (Habermas's [1972] theory of knowledge constitutive interests and sociology of phronesis [Flyvbjerg, 20011) on which the definition of the problem is based and on which the interpretation of the empirical material is performed and insights about the practice generated and understood. The elements also include the method (cooperative inquiry, Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, & Lowe, 1991) of generating the empirical material--that is, the data about the practice of <span class="hit">project</span> managers. Finally, returning to the philosophical and theoretical considerations of praxis, skills, and personal learning processes (Dreyfus, 2004), some practical propositions and new directions will be outlined for the development of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> skills and knowledge. Building on that, the paper proposes an evaluation framework for <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> training and educational programs.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Background and Rationale</font></b><br/>    The intention of this paper is to address, in a critical and constructive manner, a prominent debate in the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> field about the nature of knowledge, skills, and competencies that are relevant to practicing <span class="hit">project</span> managers in their everyday coping with the complexity of contemporary <span class="hit">projects</span>. The relevance of conventional approaches to the practice of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>, of the body of knowledge that governs it, and of the criteria for <span class="hit">project</span> success, has been contested in recent years by both practitioners and academics (Atkinson, 1999; Balck, 1994; Boddy & Patton, 2004; Fincham, 2002; Flyvbjerg, 2001; Flyvbjerg, Holm & Buhl, 2002; Hodgson, 2002; Hodgson & Cicmil, 2006; Kreiner, 1995; Laszlo, 1994; Maylor, 2001; Saad, Cicmil, & Greenwood, 2002).<br/>    The critique focuses on the functionalist/positivist goal of disseminating "best practice" in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> to masses of practitioners, with an implicit belief in the possibility of the progressive rationalization of social action and of com modification of the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> body of knowledge. "Best practice" prescriptions suggest that their correct application can enhance the chances of success over a wide range of different <span class="hit">projects</span> (PMI, 2000; 2004). The implications of this legacy for <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> "best practice" are summarized in Table 1.<br/>    A growing volume of critical voices have, in a similar manner, articulated the dangers of a wide- and fast-spreading process of commodification of knowledge across <span class="hit">management</span> fields through the dominance of narrow, normative approaches to studying the practice of <span class="hit">management</span>, which focus on planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling, but do not fully reflect organizational reality as messy, ambiguous, fragmented and political in character (see, for example, Hodgson, & Cicmil, 2006). The study discussed in this paper explores, through an alternative research approach, the practitioners' views on useful knowledge and skills in <span class="hit">project</span> environments, and their relationship with both the <span class="hit">traditional</span> set of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> best practice recommendations and alternative concepts of practical wisdom and context-dependent value-rationality and political virtuosity. This contributes to our understanding of a statement in the PMI document, the PMBOK(R) Guide, that, in the final analysis, the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> team is responsible for determining what knowledge is appropriate for any given <span class="hit">project</span> under its specific circumstances.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">An Integrated Research Framework</font></b><br/>    A significant body of literature on <span class="hit">management</span> research addresses the relationship between the research process and the nature of knowledge created through this process. Figure1 is a possible representation of the interconnected ness of the elements in the process of <span class="hit">management</span> research. It invokes, for example, an assertion made by a number of authors (e.g., Alvesson & Deetz, 2000; Arbnor& Bjerke, 1997; Calori, 2002; Cicmil & Hodgson, 2006; Easterby-Smith et al., 1991; Introna, 1997; Johnson & Duberley, 2000; Mitroff & Linstone 1993; Seale, 1999; Silverman, 2001; Stacey, 2003; Weick, 2002) that the decision to study a <span class="hit">management</span>-related topic in a particular way involves a philosophical choice by the researcher about what is important. This choice is made simultaneously with, not in isolation from, the researcher's understanding of the phenomena or issues of interest, and the area of study within which it is situated. This conscious engagement with a certain set of assumptions is based on the premise that "what one decides to study, has methodological consequences" (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995, p. 73). The research methodology will, therefore, reflect and require a serious consideration of the level of inquiry (macro or micro), the type of concepts and theory being used to formulate research questions and interpret answers, and the assumptions about the nature of empirical data and how they are collected (e.g., objective statements of truth or collaborative interpretations of experience).<br/>    It is important, therefore, to understand the implications for research implied by Figure 1; notably the need to understand research as a holistic intellectual activity--spanning all three elements in Figure 1--and, very importantly, the intrinsic link between research methodology and the nature of the knowledge created in the process.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Implications for <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">Management</span> Research: Knowledge Creation and Constitutive Interests</font></b><br/>    As discussed in the previous sections, many would argue that mainstream research into <span class="hit">projects</span> and <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> relies heavily on the prescriptive and the instrumental, where the function of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is taken to be the accomplishment of some finite piece of work in a specified period of time, within a certain budget, and to agreed specification (which is, in turn, a conventional definition of <span class="hit">project</span>). Tuned in with mainstream <span class="hit">management</span> education (Cicmil & Hodgson, 2005), the widely accepted conventional <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> knowledge system tends to reduce or marginalize complex and subtle political and social processes (e.g., asymmetries of power, agency-structure relationship, intersubjective communication, identity, control, exploitation) to simplistic "critical factors" or problem areas that arguably can be removed through an appropriate corresponding action and behavior. As indicated in Figure 1, chosen ontological and theoretical approaches will shape the representation of the phenomenon under study, that is, the <span class="hit">project</span> and/or <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>--guide the choice of suitable research methods, and impact the nature of created knowledge and propositions directed to practitioners. In the process of reflection, researchers' (and practitioners') assumptions about the criteria for evaluating "relevant and useful" knowledge in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> will also surface, making a distinction between, for example, criteria focused on control and organizational performativity, and those focused on interpersonal understanding, relationships, and collaborative work, or on individual well-being and emancipation from exploitation.<br/>    According to Habermas (1972), human interests are at the heart of science, influencing the way people think, guiding the structures of work and authority, and conditioning the way people inquire into, and create knowledge of, the world. His early work proposes a threefold separation of social sciences, corresponding to three types of "cognitive interests" that human beings hold in their relation to the social and the natural worlds (Table 2).<br/>    For Habermas, none of the types of knowledge is ever neutral, but reflects this tendency or interest. Habermas's theory of knowledge-constitutive interests is seen as particularly helpful in enabling the comparison of knowledge driven by the "technical" interest for control, performativity and prediction, with that driven by the "practical" interest embedded in the human need to communicate with others and develop inter-subjective understanding in the context in which they find themselves being together, and with self-reflective knowledge driven by the "emancipatory" interest "aimed at the realization of autonomy from defective actions and utterances arising from social relations of power, domination, and alienation" (Oliga, 1996, p. 152). In this light, the prescriptions of the mainstream systemic <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> theory outlined in the preceding section (Table 1) can be seen as governed by the "'echnical" interest that dominates the mainstream body of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> thought with a tendency to subordinate the process of knowledge creation to the production of efficiency.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">An Illustrative Study: An Inquiry into <span class="hit">Project</span> Managers' Knowledge and Skills</font></b><br/>    By making reference to Figure 1 as an overarching framework and the preceding discussion, the following section outlines and explains a critical interpretative research approach used in a study that aimed at examining the nature of <span class="hit">project</span> managers' conduct and action in their local situations and the kind of knowledge and skills that they used in their daily coping with the complexities of <span class="hit">project</span> arrangements.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Theoretical Positioning and the Focus of Inquiry: Understanding <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">Management</span> as a Social Conduct</font></b><br/>    It is believed that alternatives to instrumental rationalism are needed. Nowadays, according to Flyvbjerg (2001), the question of balancing instrumental rationality with value-rationality is becoming pertinent in all spheres of decision-making, practice, and policy development. Flyvbjerg uses phronesis to put forward his notion of the manager as a "virtuoso social and political actor" whose virtues include reflexivity, ethics, value rationality, and the use of judgment, and intuition in context. Citing Aristotle, Flyvbjerg thus argues in favor of practical rationality in <span class="hit">management</span>, understood as "...the possession of the single virtue of prudence (which) carr(ies) with it the possession of them all" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p. 60).<br/>    The notion of praxis becomes central to theorizing skills, knowledge, and competencies. "Praxis" is a form of action that is fundamentally contingent on context-dependent judgment and situational ethics. Flyvbjerg argues that the "feel for the game" is central to all human action of any complexity, and it enables "an infinite number of 'moves' to be made, adapted to the infinite number of possible situations, which no rule, however complex, can foresee" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p. 136). This does not exclude instrumental rationality as an important aspect of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> as a social skill, but insists on balancing it with value rationality, which means recognizing and coping with the operation of power in any social setting, the need for intuition, multiple perspective, holistic thinking, and moral and ethical consideration as part of complex human interaction and relating. This conception contrasts sharply with the functionalist assumption, implicit in many accounts of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> education, which limits itself to instrumental rationality and therefore constructs the <span class="hit">project</span> manager as a skillful technician (Cicmil & Hodgson, 2005).<br/>    The argument developed in this paper attempts to shed some light on the process of determining the appropriate deployment of skills and knowledge by experienced practicing <span class="hit">project</span> managers in their local <span class="hit">project</span> settings. Do practicing <span class="hit">project</span> managers see themselves as "skillful technicians," "rational implementers," "purposeful communicators" of <span class="hit">project</span> goals and plans (see Table 1)? What are their experiences and views on important skills, knowledge, and virtues in their everyday job as <span class="hit">project</span> managers?<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Research Philosophy and Methodology</font></b><br/>    The methodological approach and the interpretation of empirical material (presented and explained in the next sections) are guided by the proposition that <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is a social conduct, and that practice-based knowledge is bounded by its contextual nature; therefore, the usefulness of the universal set of <span class="hit">management</span> skills and techniques for successful completion of <span class="hit">projects</span> is brought into question. The study was guided by the key postulates of Habermas's theory of knowledge constitutive interests (the latter two in Table 2), and used Flyvbjerg's interpretation of phronesis or practical wisdom as its critical philosophical framework, and Calori's (2002) "pragmatic epistemology" as a corresponding methodological approach. The research method was designed as a participative inquiry (Easterby-Smith et al., 1991; Johnson & Duberley, 2000; Reason, 1988) based on the technique of active interviewing (Silverman, 2001).<br/>    The methodological approach of "pragmatic epistemology" suggested by Calori (2002) enables researchers and practitioners to address together the important issues of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> praxis such as social responsibility, intuition, judgment, emotions, the operation of dominant discourses, power-knowledge relationship, and practical wisdom, which are rarely captured by conventional research methodologies in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>. This perspective "deliberately seek[s] out information for answering questions about what structural factors influence individual actions, how those actions are constructed, and their structural consequences" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p. 138). This methodological approach corresponds to the opening paragraph of Chapter 1 in PMI's PMBOK(R) Guide (2004), which states that <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> body of knowledge "rests with the practitioners and academics who apply and advance it." Involving reflective practitioners and pragmatic researchers who engage together in co-authoring theories and creating knowledge which is immediate, pragmatic, and contextualized, the methods of gathering and interpreting the empirical material are governed by the methodological guidelines summarized as follows (see also Figure 2):<br/>    * The research study is concerned with social conduct in local situations; it follows Habermas's idea of knowledge constitutive interests and focuses on social interactions and issues of power, identity, and emancipation as key to the process and outcomes of managerial conduct in <span class="hit">project</span> environments;<br/>    * Researchers are interested in unusual things and activities rather than "universal" elements of perceived "good practice"; In a number of cases, the interviews took place on actual <span class="hit">project</span> sites as part of educational programs and training sessions, allowing the researchers to observe <span class="hit">project</span> managers in action;<br/>    * The study is designed as a participative cooperative inquiry based on active interviewing, involving reflective practitioners and pragmatic researchers who engage together in co-authoring theories and creating knowledge which is immediate, pragmatic, and contextualized. Both the participants and the researchers are encouraged to think more deeply about the research topic, and the implications of potential outcomes of the research for a wider range of interested parties;<br/>    * Reflection and multiple perspectives approach are encouraged, fundamental to any form of participative research is that "it makes a difference to individual's experience and that those who are being researched play an active role in the process, rather than being passive subjects" (Johnson & Duberley, 2000, p. 139). This is summarized by Alvesson and Deetz (2000, p. 145):<br/></p><blockquote>While many researchers at the end of the twentieth century conceptualize and teach their subjects to be objects--to be known and acted upon--objects can be taught to be subjects who know and act. The point is then not to produce a new theory of domination as knowledge, but to produce ways of seeing and thinking and contexts for action in which groups can express themselves and act.</blockquote><p>    * Interpretation of the empirical material reflecting the experiences of <span class="hit">project</span> practitioners is guided by the principles of a pragmatic inquiry (Calori 2002; Flyvbjerg, 2001) where ontologically <span class="hit">projects</span> and <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> are seen as processes of communicative and power relating among actors who use a variety of skills, value-perspectives, and types of knowledge (not only the instrumental-rational prescription of good practice) to deal with complexities of <span class="hit">projects</span> with virtuosity and confidence (Cicmil & Marshall, 2005).<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Credibility of the Approach</font></b><br/>    An interpretative qualitative methodology itself can present the researcher with a significant challenge as it involves much more uncertainty and ambiguity than <span class="hit">traditional</span> positivist research, and demands a high level of communicative skills, richness of one's vocabulary, sensitivity to moral and ethical issues, and a wide theoretical repertoire. It also requires an enormous amount of both enthusiasm and personal discipline, and a willingness to take risks that inevitably come with interrelating with people in a research situation which has a participative character. This runs counter to <span class="hit">traditional</span> research where the researcher would assume authority implicit in the inquiry process based on rigorous methodological rules for providing objective knowledge. In the study presented here, the respondents are seen as repositories of knowledge about their "reality," which can be transmitted to the researcher through carefully thought-out process of asking questions and interpreting answers. The researcher's responsibility (and competence), on the other hand, is to formulate questions and provide an atmosphere conducive to open communication between the interviewer and respondent.<br/>    Evaluating quality of this type of non-positivist, qualitative research and its credibility (reliability, validity, and generalizability), requires a set of specific criteria, too. The criteria of trustworthiness and relevance are seen as the key ones (Arbnor & Bjerke, 1997; Seale, 1 999). This means that detailed records of the field work/interviews must be kept and the interpretative framework made explicit, while the peer-review process, practitioners' feedback, and the public evaluation of outcomes are required to justify relevance. <span class="hit">Traditional</span> notions of reliability and validity rely on "objectivity," which has a different meaning in a qualitative piece of research. "Objectivity," therefore, in an interpretative approach can be seen as encompassing honesty, ethics, and high moral standards.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Data Analysis and Discussion of Insights</font></b><br/>    The interviews evolved around the questions conceptualized as "interrogation" of the postulates in Table 1 with the aim of broadening it with insights from praxis. In a pursuit of the answer to the question of what it might mean and take to be a high performer or a virtuoso <span class="hit">project</span> manager, the respondents were asked to reflect on (1) key challenges that they have faced in their practice and the ways (skills and knowledge) used for coping with these; (2) their own performance as <span class="hit">project</span> managers and how they perceive their development over time; (3) personal career aspirations; and (4) the role of training in developing the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> expertise.<br/>    The process of identifying the respondents to take part in the interviews relied in the majority of cases on the opinion of senior managers, human resource managers, peers or the company training team, about who could be perceived as a high performer. The participants were sought from organizations that operate in the sectors that are intensively <span class="hit">project</span>-based in <span class="hit">traditional</span> terms, namely construction, aerospace engineering, and defense procurement, and that have invested in developing their <span class="hit">project</span> managers either through in-house training programs or courses provided externally (such as academic educations including MBA or <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>-specific masters courses). Twenty six <span class="hit">project</span> managers were interviewed, all of them being experienced <span class="hit">project</span> managers (more than 10 years relevant experience). All the participants, without exception, had a degree in engineering, and their experience with <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> ranged between 10-25 years.<br/>    The key insight from the interpretation and analysis of the empirical material confirms that practical experiences with <span class="hit">projects</span> are organizational and socio-political processes. Key themes that emerged from this cooperative inquiry in relation to the questions asked in the interviews are summarized in Table 3 against the conventional assumptions about <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice captured in the mainstream body of literature and training materials. The following discussion will illustrate the three underlying concerns expressed in the interview accounts.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">About the Nature of <span class="hit">Project</span> Plans</font></b><br/>    Some interesting insights emerged when the subjects were asked to comment on the practice of <span class="hit">project</span> planning. Experienced <span class="hit">project</span> managers always already know that plans will not stand up to the scrutiny of reality. According to this study, in those moments of dislocation when the <span class="hit">project</span> seems to be out of control and rational decision-making seems to lose its base, what matters is the quality of interaction with others and the nurturing of relationships: "There is nothing like a joint and shared experience to establish a common language and help develop that team ethos and culture." (Respondent PM3)<br/>    <span class="hit">Project</span> managers seem to intuitively know that <span class="hit">project</span> plans are not the first step toward control, but an opportunity to build alliances, negotiate meaning, reinterpret the <span class="hit">project</span> in the moments of dislocation (simultaneously "knowing" and "not knowing," "being" and "not being" in control). For example,<br/></p><blockquote>"It is more than setting the objective...it's motivating people to focus on particular issues that are likely to make the difference between success and failure. So, it's having greater insight, having greater ability to think through the end of the issue and motivate people to behave in a way that enables you to actually achieve the objective, not to fall short of it." (Respondent PM1)</blockquote><p>    In addition, the issues of <span class="hit">project</span> success/failure are not seen as polarized end-states, nor are they seen as purely social constructions which leave practitioners with no power to act:<br/></p><blockquote>"To be successful one has to have that extra piece of personal magic. That personal magic brings people with him. Somehow when life gets tricky, your leadership has got to shine through, showing determination and direction and motivation..." (Respondent PM2)</blockquote><p><b><font size="-1">Rational and Intuitive Aspects of <span class="hit">Project</span> Control</font></b><br/>    The interviews revealed that the experienced <span class="hit">project</span> managers understand <span class="hit">project</span> control in the light of the political nature of <span class="hit">projects</span> and ultimate unpredictability of future actions and their consequences. Their experiences with controlling <span class="hit">projects</span> appear to be the richest source of personal learning and skill development opportunities. As summarized in Table 3, the participants' reflections during the interviews illuminated some alternative competencies and skills believed to be helpful in practice:<br/>    "I think the biggest challenge in managing <span class="hit">projects</span> is politics that you do not necessarily have the tools and training to overcome, it is something that you pick up on the job, how to manage all the political interactions. You may have a <span class="hit">project</span> plan, and all the bits in place, but actually it's all those stakeholders, how they interact, what their hidden agendas are, that matters." (Respondent PM4)<br/>    Or,<br/></p><blockquote>"The most obvious skills that I developed over the years of my <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> experience are confidence and ability to manage high levels of complexity, fast moving situations, ability to listen to other people, to manage people, to reflect..." (Respondent PM6)</blockquote><p>    The participating practitioners felt that the key skill in the successful <span class="hit">management</span> of <span class="hit">projects</span> under such conditions is the ability of individuals to engage in communication and conversation in such a way that the anxiety (their own and that of others) resulting form unpredictability, polyphony of voices, and the complex interplay of the procedures and ideologies, could be made "liveable" and that some collaborative learning and understanding could be created about how to go-on together to accomplish what is required. For example, one of the participants said: "It is all about developing a feel for what is important and making sure you talk to people who are participating on the <span class="hit">project</span>." (Respondent PM7)<br/></p><blockquote>"If you were a great analyst you could try and sit down and manage the tensions, but you really need to experience people's responses and reactions and behavior ... you absorb them, learn how difficult they are to deal with and then you start to become more sensitive to their needs and you improve your techniques for dealing with them. At the same time you become better at planning and managing and controlling the <span class="hit">project</span> because you somehow, intuitively, make allowance for all these hiccups that you hadn't done before." (Respondent PM2)</blockquote><p>    Ethical and moral considerations are seen as part of action in complex <span class="hit">project</span> environments. The <span class="hit">project</span> practitioners intuitively engage in dialoguing with a polyphony of voices and recognize values above and beyond performativity, universal rules and approaches to risk, to include considerations for environment, safety and future collaborative opportunities. Some examples of such accounts and insights are:<br/></p><blockquote>"<span class="hit">management</span> of <span class="hit">project</span> stakeholders and response to change... also means having flexibility.., respecting objectives of others and taking them into account instead of following own agenda." (Respondent PM7)</blockquote><p>    Or<br/></p><blockquote>"I take on a wider perspective...As a <span class="hit">project</span> manager, I've grown more comfortable with taking decisions without all the facts. Yes, intuitively. And, yes, I use my judgment on the basis of previous experience. I reflect in the margins of work. <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is a political issue and you must understand the wider picture. And it takes both training and experience to help you understand that." (Respondent PM3)</blockquote><p>    The significant role of emotions, values, moral and ethical considerations in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice came out as an important consideration:<br/></p><blockquote>"One thing I have learned over time is that people are much more connected to things they really believe and their emotional attachment to things they really believe has a much greater role in determining their behavior." (Respondent PM1)</blockquote><blockquote>"I am driven by my own idealized vision of the <span class="hit">project</span> and this environment.. Although it is utopia, I still like to try and reach it. Of course, I never do without modifying it on the way." (Respondent PM2)</blockquote><p><b><font size="-1">On Personal Learning and Skill Development</font></b><br/>    The aim of the study was to broaden the understanding of the kind of skills and knowledge that practitioners use (or find helpful) in managing <span class="hit">projects</span>, in relation to the conventional tools, techniques and the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> body of knowledge. According to the practicing <span class="hit">project</span> managers, experience in the specific context is the most significant contributor to learning. Reflecting on the role of formal training and education in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>, there was a strong agreement that situated learning is most valuable, as expressed in the following:<br/></p><blockquote>"Formal training in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> was interesting but 'it was no substitute for doing the job on different <span class="hit">projects</span>, under different circumstances, at different levels..." (Respondent PM1)</blockquote><blockquote>"There is in my view a certain long term requirement to <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> development--to cut your teeth." (Respondent PM2)</blockquote><blockquote>"...Case studies are very interesting but I could walk away from a case study an unchanged person. I've never been able to walk away from a <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> job an unchanged person." (Respondent PM1)</blockquote><p>    The propositions summarized in Table 3 articulate the output of this qualitative research, which challenges the image of "rational, purposeful, professional, thinking manager" who makes informed decisions based on information processing and then designs the system and acts.<br/></p><blockquote>"You need to understand how they are linked together and to your reality. On <span class="hit">projects</span>, everything is interconnected in a political environment. ... In addition to the tools and techniques, you need the inherent understanding of what makes the organization thick, who the stakeholders are and what influence others have in the organization. This is contextual knowledge that you gain through experience and reflection." (Respondent PM3)</blockquote><p>    <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is perceived as social, context-bound practice, which cannot be reduced to a set of theories, tools, and techniques. The <span class="hit">traditional</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> tools, techniques, and theories have their place, but their use is moderated by value-rational competencies and practical wisdom.<br/></p><blockquote>"I've never found one tool to be universally applicable or right... I'd rather have a menu of tools and use all of them to a greater or lesser extent and use, what we know as human beings by going around and seeing for ourselves, as a moderator against a lot of these tools and theories." (Respondent PM1)</blockquote><p><b><font size="-1">Critical Interpretation and Re-conceptualization of the <span class="hit">Project</span> Manager's Skills and Competencies</font></b><br/>    The insights from the empirical material point out the virtues of practical wisdom and conduct in the complex social context of the studied <span class="hit">projects</span>, that include the <span class="hit">project</span> managers' paying attention to the quality of conversations that enable action; to the anxiety and how it is lived with, and to the ways of dealing and coping with unpredictability and paradox. The clear indication is that they perform as "involved-in-the-world social and political actors" rather than as "objective observers" tasked with controlling the <span class="hit">project</span>. Actions and dispositional behaviors of practitioners are influenced by their own identity and processes of sense-making (of the context and its circumstances) where actors apply their implicit rules in combination with the external ones explicated in manuals and procedures. Improvisation is part of coping and acting, as external rules cannot account for their own interpretation in situ by actors. The actors' responses are governed by skills that have in time and with experience become reflexively automatic and intuitive, and as important for good results as are analysis, rationality and rules (Clegg & Ross-Smith, 2003; Flivbjerg, 2001). This conclusion leads to a proposition to open up the field of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> to a phronetic examination of both how <span class="hit">projects</span> "become" and what skills and knowledge are required to manage them. Seeing <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> as social action in context would mean a return to the fact that the nature of organizations and organizing is laden with complex tensions between rationality and intuition, and between scientific, prediction driven knowledge and "the feel for the game" in the context. Therefore, there might not be any final answers to successful <span class="hit">management</span> of <span class="hit">projects</span> nor final methodology for finding an answer.<br/>    This implies an approach to <span class="hit">management</span> development and education, as well as <span class="hit">management</span> research, in which "discursive plurality is accepted and acknowledged, and where obstinate differences in domain assumptions are explicitly tolerated" (Clegg & Ross-Smith, 2003, p. 85). Consequently, the distinguishing feature of <span class="hit">project</span> managers is not control but the ability to operate effectively, and to individually and collectively maintain their sense of self and their defenses against uncertainty. Intentional goal-oriented actions emerge in the conversations of practitioners, managers and non-managers alike, at a local level, and those conversations function as meaning-making processes. "Courage to carry on creatively despite not knowing and not being in control, with all the anxiety that this brings" (Stacey, 2003, p. 393). It also means departing from the image of rational, purposeful, knowledgeable, professional manager, who makes sense of what is happening in the organization on the basis of information, then rationally analyzes the situation, and designs the system of action that will ensure desired outcomes.<br/>    Table 4 integrates the proposed positions and represents the final contribution of this study about knowledge, interaction, and <span class="hit">project</span> work, and its journey from instrumental rationality to practical wisdom. In summary, the following relevant propositions that have resulted from this research can be developed against the five steps of the human learning process suggested by the Dreyfus model of human learning (Cicmil, Williams, Thomas, & Hodgson, 2006; Dreyfus, 2004):<br/>    * Rule-governed analytical rationality of the first three levels, in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> context, is the kind of knowledge that forms the basis of textbooks, <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> software packages, prescriptive methods and procedures formulated in a number of checklists promoted on training courses, and in a majority of versions of the PMBOK(R) Guide--people are trained in context-independent knowledge and rules.<br/>    * Analytical rationality alone is inadequate "for the best results in the exercise of a profession, as student, researcher, or practitioner" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p. 71). The importance of gaining concrete experience is a precondition for reaching the top two levels of the intuitive, holistic, and synchronous performance of tacit skills. Analytical rationality and rules-based <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> knowledge are important and should not be discounted, but "to make them the highest goal of learning is regressive" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p. 71).<br/>    * Con text-dependent knowledge and experience is at the crux of expert or virtuoso activity; these two final levels in the learning process can be reached only via a person's own experiences as practitioner of the relevant skills.<br/>    * <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> education should enable the development of concrete, context-dependent knowledge by encouraging reflective participative understanding of organizational processes as circular complex responsive processes of conversational and power relating.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">Conclusions</font></b><br/>    This article has illustrated how, by interpreting the empirical material gathered in the process of prolonged active interviewing (a qualitative method of data collection) and collaborative participative interpretation of the accounts reflecting the experiences of <span class="hit">project</span> practitioners (interpretative method of data analysis), we can generate alternative understandings of what goes on in <span class="hit">project</span> practice and how practitioners participate in and manage complex organizational arrangements labeled <span class="hit">projects</span> in their local environments. The interpretation of the empirical material signifies the problematic nature of <span class="hit">project</span> implementation and the role of <span class="hit">project</span> managers as "implementers." <span class="hit">Project</span> goals and plans are seen as frequently ambiguous, but their ambiguities are not only a result of shortcomings on the side of decision-makers and planners, but also frequently an inevitable consequence of gaining necessary support for the <span class="hit">project</span>, and of changing preferences over time. Everyday experiences of the practicing <span class="hit">project</span> managers who participated in this study suggest a different picture about the practice of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> from the more common representations in extant research. The associated set of skills identified in this study as useful and relevant to the practice of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> cannot be conventionally typologized under a number of discrete types of competencies that cumulatively could then be taken as making up a "profile" of a successful <span class="hit">project</span> manager. The findings of this research call for a closer link between the practical knowledge and the learning processes that individuals go through in their development as <span class="hit">project</span> managers. Such research results can contribute to the debate about what it is that managers do when they "manage" in their local contexts, what knowledge is perceived as useful for managerial action, and how managers learn and develop their skills.<br/>ADDED MATERIAL<br/>    SVETLANA CICMIL, PhD, is the head of research in operations and information <span class="hit">management</span> and director of MBA Programmes at Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, UK.
