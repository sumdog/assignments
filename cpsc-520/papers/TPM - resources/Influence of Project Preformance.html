The agency used these stakeholders to procure construction services for maintaining its roads. During the course of the <span class="hit">project</span>, the HA changed its focus from a <span class="hit">traditional</span>, compulsory competitive tendering-type (CCT) strategy to one based on the HA's construction <span class="hit">Management</span> Pilot (CMP) scheme. Part of the change involved the HA's introduction of a performance <span class="hit">management</span> system (PMS); this system offers a multi-dimensional and multi-observational perspective of success. This paper discusses the benefits of the new strategy and the issues and problems encountered by the HA while implementing the <span class="hit">project</span> plan. It also analyzes the contribution of the new PMS to the <span class="hit">project</span> strategy.<br/>    Keywords: performance; measurement; stakeholders; strategy.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">INTRODUCTION</font></b><br/>    Traditionally, the distinction between good and poor <span class="hit">project</span> performance was defined by the <span class="hit">project</span> team's meeting cost, time, and product quality-related criteria, which researchers such as Atkinson (1999) have been described as the iron triangle of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>. This iron triangle is still regarded as the measure for gauging team performance on all types of <span class="hit">projects</span>. (The prevalence of this notion was recently confirmed by White and Fortune (2002) in their survey of 236 <span class="hit">project</span> managers representing 88 UK-based private and public sector organizations.) In the literature on the construction industry, other authors have described iron triangle performance requirements as the need to predict <span class="hit">project</span> costs, to confirm that <span class="hit">projects</span> will finish on time, and to verify in <span class="hit">project</span> documents that quality-related standards are met (Chan & Tam, 2000; Love, Gunasekaran, & Li, 1998).<br/>    Using the iron triangle as their measure, these authors reported that poor performance on construction <span class="hit">projects</span> typically causes significant cost and schedule overruns; Gardiner and Stewart (2000) add that these types of <span class="hit">projects</span> also fail to meet quality-related specifications. Lim and Zain Mohamed (2000) found in their exploratory study of electrical transmission substation <span class="hit">projects</span> in Malaysia that some of the factors causing cost and schedule overruns are not unique to construction <span class="hit">projects</span>. These factors include the <span class="hit">project</span> team's lacking experience, lacking appropriate skills, and lacking knowledge; these, the study revealed, are common and expected problems that recur <span class="hit">project</span> after <span class="hit">project</span>.<br/>    In contrast, White & Fortune's research (2002), which reported that 41 percent of the people they surveyed believed the outcome of their <span class="hit">projects</span> were a complete success, reported that the interviewees recognized environmental characteristics that are not present in all <span class="hit">projects</span>. The characteristics, said the interviewees, contributed to the difficulty of ensuring <span class="hit">project</span> success in the construction business sector. For example, Lim and Zain Mohamed (2000), in addition to finding generic problems such as lack of skills, experience, and skills, encountered construction <span class="hit">project</span>-specific problems, such as a lack of site supervisors, unusual site conditions, and new <span class="hit">project</span> participants unfamiliar with the industry. Likewise, in an analysis of the types of delays that affect the early stages of construction <span class="hit">projects</span>, Yates and Eskander (2002) reported, in their study of 101 United States (US) engineering and construction industry professionals, 20 different types of <span class="hit">project</span> delays, some of which include changing the <span class="hit">project</span>'s requirements and developing multiple <span class="hit">projects</span> with higher priorities.<br/>    Yates and Eskander (2002) also noted in their study that the two most common causes for these delays are constant changes to the <span class="hit">project</span>'s requirements and a lack of communication among the various <span class="hit">project</span> parties. These, however, are generic problems that can affect the outcome of all types of <span class="hit">projects</span>. The organizational fragmentation inherent in the <span class="hit">traditional</span> client/contractor/consultant relationship on construction <span class="hit">projects</span> -- as reported by Berggren, Soderlund, and Anderson (2001) -- is exacerbating generic <span class="hit">project</span> problems experienced in other industries, such as large-scale engineering. Because of this, it is likely that these generic problems contribute to the <span class="hit">project</span>-specific problems <span class="hit">project</span> leaders encounter as they attempt to effectively and efficiently manage construction <span class="hit">projects</span>.<br/>    Since the 1980's, researchers and practitioners have developed other measures of performance beyond the iron triangle. These measures have led to a redefining of what constitutes good and poor <span class="hit">project</span> performance. A consensus has emerged in the literature that states performance is more complex than merely measuring cost, time, and quality. Performance, states the literature, is measured using various criteria, such as the perspectives of different groups of people involved in the <span class="hit">project</span> and the different stages of a <span class="hit">project</span>'s life. Such a perspective of measurement is described as a multidimensional and multi-observational approach (Shenha.r, Levy, & Dvir, 1997). In taking this perspective, theorists have identified two distinct components for measuring <span class="hit">project</span> performance: <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> success and product/<span class="hit">project</span> success. The first focuses on the iron triangle and on the criteria used to implement the <span class="hit">project</span>; the second relates to the longer-term results yielded by the <span class="hit">project</span>'s final product (Baccarini, 1999; Cooke-Davies, 2002; De Witt, 1988).<br/>    Given that a construction <span class="hit">project</span> is not completed until after the <span class="hit">project</span> delivery stage, when the facility is open and operating (Munns & Bjeirmi, 1996), <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> success and product/<span class="hit">project</span> success perspectives suggest that in order for researchers and practitioners to be able to accurately measure the <span class="hit">project</span>'s performance, their measurement must incorporate criteria that considers the <span class="hit">project</span>'s life beyond delivery. These criteria may include meeting the long-term financial objectives of the client -- such as internal rate of return -- and satisfying the objectives of customers and users, such as their requirements for functionality and operability. The criteria should also gauge the <span class="hit">project</span>'s ability to meet the objectives of external bodies, which includes complying with statutory and health and safety requirements (Jaafari, 2000). These requirements may also include the <span class="hit">project</span>'s satisfying psychosocial criteria (Pinto & Pinto 1991), such as gauging the client- and subcontractor-satisfaction with the way the <span class="hit">project</span> was managed. Therefore, in assessing performance of a construction <span class="hit">project</span>, <span class="hit">project</span> leaders must judge the <span class="hit">project</span> both during and after the operational phase. The aim is to assess whether or not the <span class="hit">project</span> met its objectives (Cox & Townsend, 1998, p. 26; Morris & Hough, 1987, p. 193). Using measures that take the broader multi-dimensional, multi-observational perspective, the literature often records problems of performance. For example, Lim & Zain Mohamed (1999) document one client's dissatisfaction with the outcome of their construction <span class="hit">project</span>, the <span class="hit">project</span> team that delivered their <span class="hit">project</span> and the supplier organizations that serviced the <span class="hit">project</span>.<br/>    The history of poor performance on construction <span class="hit">projects</span>, whatever the measure used, is the backdrop against which both the private and public sectors have sought to identify alternative <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> methods. Such alternative methods could enable these sectors to more successfully realize their <span class="hit">project</span> goals. The underlying goal of this endeavor is to ultimately improve <span class="hit">project</span> performance. The limitations of the <span class="hit">traditional</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> methods were reported in UK government-led reviews, such as those produced by Latham (1994) and Egan (1998); these reviews highlighted an increase in pressure on public sector construction <span class="hit">projects</span> to embrace new ways of working. These reviewers pushed <span class="hit">project</span> teams to the point where they become examples of best practice. However, the reviewers found that the <span class="hit">traditional</span> methods caused conflict and disputes between client and contractor, disruptions which resulted in many dients resorting to litigation to resolve their differences. Such behavior increased animosity between dients and <span class="hit">project</span> teams and raised mutual suspicion that each party was trying to leverage advantage over the other. Researchers have also found that stakeholders working in the construction industry recognize the limitations of working under the <span class="hit">traditional</span> methods.<br/>    A study by Black, Akintoye, and Fitzgerald (2000) surveyed 78 individuals -- construction clients, contractors, and consultants -- and found that these individuals generally agreed about the specific failings that result from using the <span class="hit">traditional</span> methods: exploitation, rigid specification, decisions made with limited knowledge, and short-term focus. It is within this context of external pressure to change and internal recognition of current failings that the construction industry now seeks to respond to the challenges set before it: to improve its performance in serving clients and in working with organizations in the supply chain.<br/>    At the same time that the construction industry has been facing up to this demand for new methods, researchers and practitioners in other <span class="hit">project</span> domains (such as performance <span class="hit">management</span> and quality <span class="hit">management</span>) have adapted and applied to the <span class="hit">management</span> of <span class="hit">projects</span>, as the literature documents, changes that are moving the discipline of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> from a <span class="hit">project</span>-related performance perspective to a multi-dimensional and multi-observational perspective. For example, Stewart (2001) developed an approach to check the health of a <span class="hit">project</span> throughout its life cycle using the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach which was developed by Kaplan & Norton (1992). In my previous research (Bryde, 2003), I, Dr. Bryde also developed a model for distinguishing between different levels of performance by using a Business Excellence Model framework (British Quality Foundation, 1998). Such initiatives are predicated on the belief that multi-dimensional, multi-observational performance <span class="hit">management</span> systems (PMSs) have a use in <span class="hit">project</span> environments.<br/>    The wider literature on <span class="hit">management</span> reports on the use of multidimensional/multi-observational-base d PMSs in a variety of business sectors: Walters (1999) studied the case of the Estates <span class="hit">Management</span> Department of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation of Hong Kong; Kald and Nilsson (2000) surveyed 200 business units in Scandinavia; De Toni and Tonchia (2001) studied 115 Italian firms from the mechanical, electro-mechanical, and electronic industries; and Hlavacka, Bacharova, Rusnakova, and Wagner (2001) investigated the health care sector in Slovakia. All these studies confirm the relevance of using PMSs. However, one common theme to emerge from these studies is the difficulty in establishing <span class="hit">management</span> processes that allow for the practical implementation of PMSs. This difficulty is partly caused by the inherent complexity of the multidimensional/multi-observational perspective, with its different stakeholders using different success criteria (key performance indicators, or KPIs) or different competing values when defining successful performance (Walton & Dawson, 2001). Given that <span class="hit">projects</span> are typically characterized as containing diverse and vocal stakeholder groups, as noted by Cleland (1986), it is likely that such complexity and competing values are present in many <span class="hit">project</span> environments, including those related to construction <span class="hit">projects</span>.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE RESEARCH CONTEXT</font></b><br/>    Our literature review showed us that <span class="hit">project</span> teams need to take a multidimensional and multi-observational perspective regarding performance in <span class="hit">project</span> environments; our review also showed that against both <span class="hit">traditional</span> and current measures of performance, the failings of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practices in many industries, including construction, have historically resulted in poor levels of team performance. Our review highlights the way that new PMSs have been developed in response to the industry's wanting multi-dimensional and multi-observational perspectives; we also encountered the practical difficulty of successfully integrating a PMS that accurately reflects the various perspectives of different stakeholders into <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice.<br/>    From our research, we found that by studying a <span class="hit">project</span> that changed the team's <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice, which included modifications to its PMS, we could explore whether a change in the way performance was measured and managed would influence the team's perceptions of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> and product/<span class="hit">project</span> success. In addition to this, we examined the inherent complexity and competing values in the <span class="hit">project</span> environment to see how, if at all, PMSs were successfully integrated into the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> system.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE RESEARCH STUDY</font></b><br/>    We collected data by investigating the attitudes and experiences of <span class="hit">project</span> stakeholders working on a four-yearlong Managing Agent Contract <span class="hit">project</span> in the North West of England for the Highways Agency (HA). This contract involved the team's providing construction services for maintaining trunk roads and motorways. The procurement strategy for this <span class="hit">project</span> changed from a <span class="hit">traditional</span>, compulsory competitive tendering (CCT)-type in its early stages to one based on the HA's Construction <span class="hit">Management</span> Pilot (CMP) scheme.<br/>    Theoretically, CMP schemes differ from CCT strategies in a number of ways. In CMP, specialist contractors are appointed to carry out work for the duration of the <span class="hit">project</span>, rather than the client bidding out each phase under separate contract within the overall <span class="hit">project</span>. And while several contractors are appointed to each specialist trade package, work under the CMP is shared among the contractors. From the dient's perspective, CMP has a number of aims:<br/>    * Tighter control over the quality of work produced by the contractors.<br/>    * Better <span class="hit">management</span> of direct relationships and through less sub-contracting.<br/>    * Closer integration of both design and construction skills.<br/>    * Improved flexibility in responding to client priorities.<br/>    * Less resources devoted to tendering and contract letting procedures.<br/>    * More transparent costs to help manage risk more effectively, which subsequently reduces a source of conflict.<br/>    * Shorter communication chains, which improve financial planning, resulting in more reliable outturn costs.<br/>    * Long-term relationships, leading to a more highly skilled workforce and ultimately to less product defects as the team strives for continuous improvement.<br/>    Likewise for contractors, CMP provides them with several advantages:<br/>    * Better prospect of winning business based on quality and ability.<br/>    * Prompt payment of accounts by the client.<br/>    * Continuity of workload through continuous involvement in the programming of work.<br/>    * Higher profits.<br/>    * Influence over the client's procurement strategy.<br/>    There are also other differences between the CCI and CMP. These are related to the degree in which <span class="hit">project</span> stakeholders are involved in the <span class="hit">project</span>. Table 1 illustrates these differences.<br/>    The construction manager's role in CMP, which can be compared to the resident engineer's role in a <span class="hit">traditional</span> procurement strategy, is pivotal throughout the <span class="hit">project</span> life cycle (PLC). This role links the stakeholders to the <span class="hit">project</span>. In CMP, the design team <span class="hit">project</span> manager and the specialist contractors are brought in at an earlier stage of the PLC than when using a CCT strategy, whereas the client is involved at all stages of the PLC. Suppliers only become involved before the construction phase. CMP requires an on-going interaction among the stakeholders during the handover and operation stages. Such interaction ensures that the <span class="hit">project</span> will minimize disruptions to motorists traveling on the road network. And once construction is completed, the <span class="hit">project</span> team will review the <span class="hit">project</span>'s performance, based on stakeholder involvement. This review ensures that the <span class="hit">project</span> team members continually improve. Given CMP's emphasis on continuous improvement, this review shows the differences in PMSs between the two procurement strategies: CMP has <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPIs beyond CCT, beyond the team's meeting cost, quality, and time objectives. For example, one CMP KPI measures the client's involvement in the <span class="hit">project</span>; another KPI measures the extent to which consultants and contractors have shared knowledge, expertise, and resources during the design stage; and yet another KPI focuses on changes in the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> process. These changes encourage the team to apply best practice and prevent their re-inventing of the wheel.<br/>    Munns and Bjeirmi (1996) define the <span class="hit">project</span> closedown stage as the point when the <span class="hit">project</span> is dismantled and disposed of--the point when the <span class="hit">project</span> reaches the end of its useful life. There is no closedown stage for the HA <span class="hit">project</span> we studied because this <span class="hit">project</span> involves ongoing infrastructure maintenance. Adams and Barnd (1988) and Spirer and Hamburger (1988) have both found that other PLC models consider closedown at the end of the implementation (construction) stage.<br/>    To obtain our research data, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample population of the studied <span class="hit">project</span>'s stakeholders: <span class="hit">project</span> manager (client), design manager (managing agent), construction manager (managing agent), design team <span class="hit">project</span> manager (managing agent), and specialist contractor (contractor). These five individuals were involved at each stage of the PLC.<br/>    Though the stakeholders we interviewed held <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> positions, each had different roles and responsibilities. The construction manager, which equates to the role of resident engineer under CCT, manages the specialist contractors on the motorway network and co-ordinates the designs by the managing agent. The design manager -- an individual from within the managing agent's organization -- manages the overall design program and the budgets; this individual also co-ordinates the <span class="hit">project</span>'s progress and the amount of capital spent, in conjunction with the client. The design team's <span class="hit">project</span> manager, also employed by the managing agent, manages the design team's work and liaises with the client <span class="hit">project</span> manager, the specialist contractors, and the construction manager. Table 2 summarizes the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders we interviewed.<br/>    Our research findings offered us the opportunity to investigate the influence that the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPI has in shaping a team's perceptions of <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> success. All of our research subjects had previous experience working as managers on <span class="hit">projects</span> that used CCT, which as previously mentioned is a cost-time-quality <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPI construct. Additionally, each interviewee had experience using the CMP-based procurement strategy, the multidimensional, multi-observational <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPI construct. To better understand the roles, relationships, and interactions between the subjects interviewed, we constructed a context chart -- shown in Figure 1 -- based on a model by (Miles & Huberman, 1994, p. 102).<br/>    From our research, we noticed that a direct relationship can create a formal contractual link or a direct communications or reporting link; an indirect relationship is where the relationship between the two parties is managed via a third party or through an informal communications link.<br/>    To address the issue of construct validity that can arise from using a case study method, we used other sources of evidence, as suggested by Yin (1994, p.33). These sources included the contract documents we accessed, the HA's CMP scheme manual, and our knowledge of the contract through prior employment with the managing agent. The latter enabled us to obtain some triangulation of data. We constructed a chain of evidence by linking the literature findings to the research question and to our analysis of the research question. Finally, we passed back to each subject, for their verification, the transcript from their interview. We included with this transcript a copy of the interview framework that we used. We then analyzed our data around the issues of PMS, <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> success, product/<span class="hit">project</span> success, and <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPIs, as outlined in the previous section.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">FINDINGS</font></b><br/>    All of the subjects we interviewed believed that the CMP procurement strategy produced more successful <span class="hit">project</span> outcomes in comparison to the <span class="hit">traditional</span> CCT procurement strategy. The construction manager rated CMP as "very good," while the other four <span class="hit">project</span> stakeholders rated CMP as between "good" and "very good." None surveyed believed there was "no difference" or that CMP is "poor" or "very poor" in comparison to <span class="hit">traditional</span> methods.<br/>    In terms of the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPI construct, all of the stakeholders emphasized the importance of client satisfaction and quality. This emphasis was not affected by the change from CCr to CMP, though we saw evidence that CMP was enabling the team to enhance its performance in regards to these KPIs. This enhancement resulted after the team recognized that <span class="hit">project</span> satisfaction was influenced by changes in the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> process.<br/>    We did not see any evidence showing that the team's adopting a new procurement strategy changed the stakeholders' interest in the KPIs of cost and time. All interviewees regarded these indicators as important and essential to <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> success; but in relative terms, they rated these indicators as subordinate to the KPIs of client satisfaction and quality. Despite the lack of change in emphasis, we noticed indications that the team had improved its capacity to meet the KPIs under CMP. For example, the client's <span class="hit">project</span> manager found that <span class="hit">project</span> costs were better predicted through the profiling of expenditure on a bi-monthly basis. This profiling improved the team's ability to keep better control of the <span class="hit">project</span>'s expenses (which they kept within 5 percent of the budget). This achievement, according to the construction manager, is not a <span class="hit">project</span> expectation when using the <span class="hit">traditional</span> strategy. The client also reported a reduction in time spent on the network. Likewise, the view of cost, time, and quality failures -- such as staying on the network too long and the cost of remedial work after the main work had been completed -- had not changed under CMP; however, the team believed CMP provided them with the methods needed to better understand these issues and prevent these issues from occurring in the future.<br/>    We perceived that under the CMP strategy, the team's formal definition and measurement of individual KPIs enhanced the team's performance for the stakeholders' benefit, as compared with the results achieved with CCI The client's <span class="hit">project</span> manager stated that health and safety aspects were better planned and managed when these were formally defined as a specific KPI. According to our interviewees, having KPIs linked to the way the <span class="hit">project</span> is managed -- such as encouraging innovation, the sharing of ideas, and continuous improvement -- leads to improvements in these areas. For example, interviewees noted that one KPI related to measuring the extent to which consultants and contractors shared knowledge, expertise, and resources on-site or during the design.<br/>    The client's <span class="hit">project</span> manager stated that performance against this KPI would be discussed at every closedown meeting, thus allowing managers to identify improvements and compare performance across schemes. In addition, the focus on a wide range of both product-and process-oriented KPIs fostered an enhanced level of personal satisfaction. For example, the design team's <span class="hit">project</span> manager noted that the team's ability to be involved in the decision to change things on-site -- and the fact that this increased involvement, which subsequently led to designs being built in 3-4 months -- resulted in increased satisfaction. The construction manager described a more satisfying working relationship as a result of the team's obtaining increased interaction with the client, which in the manager's opinion led to a more open relationship and the sharing of information and ideas. For the specialist contractor, the fact that there were KPIs that focused on the need for long-term partnerships -- relationships which establish a guaranteed future workload and a continuity of work -- proved a source of personal satisfaction.<br/>    Our interviewees identified a number of critical success factors relating to their <span class="hit">project</span>. These factors include:<br/>    * Establishing relationships based on trust and mutual respect<br/>    * Having the right people in the right place<br/>    * Enlisting competent people<br/>    * Developing a clear client brief<br/>    * Maintaining a high degree of client involvement<br/>    * Establishing clear communication channels<br/>    * Ensuring the right information reached the right people<br/>    * Gaining senior <span class="hit">management</span> commitment.<br/>    The interviewees cited CMP as the element that put these factors -- which were previously absent -- into place. In addition to PMS, which made possible the placement of critical success factors (such as creating communication channels) during the <span class="hit">project</span>, another tool that the interviewees recognized as valuable was a visual-graphical output of performance. This output was typically a one-page document that showed stakeholders the <span class="hit">project</span>'s measured results against the KPIs broad groupings of customer satisfaction, construction cost, prediction of cost, prediction of time, supply base, <span class="hit">project</span> time, quality, health and safety, and productivity improvement. The interviewees reported that each broad grouping had two or three detailed KPIs. The document also allowed stakeholders to compare actual performance and target performance against benchmark schemes; additionally, the document outlined the team's performance at comparable stages of the <span class="hit">project</span> life cycle, such as during design and in the final account.<br/>    We noticed evidence of problems in reconciling the inherent complexity and the competing values of diverse perspectives held by the stakeholders; we also saw evidence of problems in aligning all the stakeholders to the new way of working. The problem of reconciling inherent complexity and competing values was evident in the responses from the client's <span class="hit">project</span> manager. For the KPI related to cost effectiveness, the client was concerned that having preferred suppliers would ultimately lead to consolidation and subsequently reduce competition. The result would restrict the market to those contractors fortunate enough to receive appointments under the new scheme. The design manager raised similar concerns, stating that specialists who did not get on the preferred supplier list would be marginalized, which would cause them to lose out on work over the next five years.<br/>    Other KPIs related to the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> process: to the degree of involvement of the various stakeholders in this process and to the involvement of the government as stakeholder, which was looking for the client to reduce the amount of <span class="hit">project</span> time involved in a contract in order to free up their staffs time to work on other things. The purpose of this involvement, for the government, was to engage this staff in its in strategic planning activities as a network operator. Yet the new scheme, and indeed the industry best practice currently being developed by this <span class="hit">project</span> team, called for increased involvement as a measure of improvement against this KPI.<br/>    We found that the problem of aligning all the stakeholders to the new way of working was highlighted in the interviews with the design manager, construction manager, and specialist contractor. All three subjects identified the problem of getting the experienced individual specialist working in the new way. In the opinion of the construction manager, this was due to the fact that working under the CMP arrangement might typically represent only one-or-two percent of the specialist contractor's turnover. The specialist contractor would, therefore, not realize the amount of effort involved, in terms of managing work to meet the demands of the various KPIs. For example, the turnover of the work would not warrant the team's commitment to participating in all of the meetings, such as the closedown meetings described earlier. In addition, there was some evidence of difficulties in simultaneously achieving improved performance across disparate KPIs. For example, the design team's <span class="hit">project</span> manager described how the client had estimated final design costs at 30-to-40 percent above the prescribed budget on a particular scheme, due to the changing of the <span class="hit">project</span>'s objectives, which in part was caused by increased client involvement. In terms of KPIs, the scheme might show an improvement in terms of stakeholder involvement, but at the same time it shows a decline in cost effectiveness.<br/>    Finally, the client's <span class="hit">project</span> manager raised the issue of the degree of measurement required under the new way of working. This individual highlighted the complexity of -- and the competing values in -- the <span class="hit">project</span> environment: striking a balance between the wider requirements of the Citizen's Charter with its obligations on minimizing network delays, while also justifying prudent spending and maintenance of a safe network. In this context, we noticed, however, a danger: too much measurement might be taking place, especially if the KPIs being measured have not been carefully developed to contribute to the organization's overall goal.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER STUDY</font></b><br/>    Our study of a four-year-long Managing Agent Contract <span class="hit">project</span> that changed its <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPI construct from a <span class="hit">traditional</span> CCT-type procurement strategy to one based on the CMP scheme highlighted that the stakeholders' perceptions of <span class="hit">project</span> success shifted with the change of strategy. All of the five stakeholders interviewed believed that using CMP schemes made it possible for the team to realize more successful <span class="hit">project</span> outcomes than when the team was using CCT strategies.<br/>    This study also highlighted a number of factors that resulted from the change in strategy, including earlier and increased stakeholder involvement and better team communications. These factors suggest that there is not one influential factor causing <span class="hit">project</span> success. Instead, <span class="hit">project</span> success is determined by a number of interrelated factors. In this context, this study suggests that a PMS constructed with multi-dimensional and multi-observational <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> KPIs may be one such factor. On its own, a new PMS might not have a significant influence on outcomes, but taken with the other factors introduced through CMP, it has -- as Figure 2 shows -- an influence on <span class="hit">project</span> outcomes.<br/>    In our case study, we found that the PMS seemed to have an influence in two ways. First, it formally defined a broad range of KPIs, such as cost, quality, and health and safety; it also focused on performance in the defined areas. This focus gave stakeholders a shared and common understanding of the outcomes prioritized. Second, the use of PMS-related tools -- such as the one-page visual communication tool used to define and monitor performance against KPIs -- provided the team with an instrument for establishing other critical success factors, such as ensuring the right information reaches the right people. This visual communication tool not only integrated the PMS with other critical success factors, it also helped the team successfully integrate PMS into the <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> system.<br/>    This study additionally revealed some of the problems linked to the inherent complexity and competing values in the <span class="hit">project</span> environment. One such problem involves achieving team consensus about KPI definition and the frequency of measuring KPIs. A second problem includes ensuring that all stakeholders understand and commit to the required new ways of working to meet all the elements of performance used by the PMS. A final problem deals with any inherent conflict between KPIs: for example, achieving better performance on a stakeholder involvement KPI might lead to poorer performance on a cost effectiveness KPI.<br/>    The changes in <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> practice that we investigated in this case study are in the early stages of implementation. Indeed, the introduction of CMP was being undertaken as a pilot scheme. Likewise, the attitudes and experiences of the <span class="hit">project</span> stakeholders have been collected as a snapshot in time, captured at one stage of the implementation of the scheme. To gain a fuller picture, it will be necessary to revisit the case at a later stage to better understand the benefits and issues of introducing new <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> methods that involve a change in the nature of a PMS. Over time, it will be possible to compare performance of the CMP approach by benchmarking it against similar schemes that used non-CMP <span class="hit">traditional</span> methods. Given the exploratory nature of this study, no wider generalized claims can be put forward in regards to our findings. Indeed, our findings may be atypical and may result from the specific nature and environment in which this <span class="hit">project</span> is occurring. Further work is required to test the validity of the exploratory findings that we have reported in this paper; such a study should look at other <span class="hit">project</span> environments that have adopted multi-dimensional and multi-observational PMSs.<br/>ADDED MATERIAL<br/>    DAVID JAMES BRYDE is a senior lecturer in operations <span class="hit">management</span> at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom (UK); he is also a research correspondent in -- and the acting head of -- Research and Doctoral Studies in the university's School of <span class="hit">Management</span>.
