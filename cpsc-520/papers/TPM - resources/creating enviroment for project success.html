The strategies provided in this column aim to help individual contributors, project managers, and IS managers take control of the project environment and increase their personal success, the success of the project team, the credibility of the IS function, and user satisfaction.</font></b><br/>       THE IS FUNCTION HAS A poor track record of delivering systems that meet user needs on time and to budget. The following statistics published in Computer Economics ("IS Budget Report," April 1996) speak for themselves:<br/></p><blockquote>* Only 18% of software projects are<br/>completed within budget.<br/>* Slightly more than half (i.e., 51%<br/>of projects are completed but over-<br/>run their budgets; the average over-<br/>run is 189% of the original estimate.<br/>* Almost a third, or 31%, of software<br/>projects become so expensive they<br/>are never completed.</blockquote><p>    This failure not only continues to fuel user dissatisfaction, it results in substantial turnover in the ranks of IS managers and continued assaults on the IS organization. The latter often manifests itself through a movement to break up or decentralize the IS function. Outsourcing is often the ultimate acknowledgment that a company has given up trying to effectively manage this function.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM</font></b><br/>       The IS function's failure to meet user expectations is not due to a lack of staff skills, staff motivation, or the appropriate methodology or tool. Instead, in almost every situation, project teams are set up for failure, because the project environment is established in a way that precludes success. One cannot plant an onion and expect an orchid to grow.<br/>    Assessment of dozens of companies and scores of projects indicates that project personnel at all levels believe they are victims of their environment. IS managers cite business demands and competition for scarce resources. In turn, project managers and staff report unrealistic target dates that preclude them from doing the job right. Thus is born a cycle of continuous rationalization of failure and poor performance.<br/>    To break this vicious cycle, all personnel involved in projects have to first admit that they will never have complete control of the factors that determine their success. Second, they need to pursue strategies that help manage their environment. Specifically, they must learn how to manage up and out to control as much as possible the factors affecting both personal and project success.<br/>    This column presents specific strategies for managing the project environment from the perspective of an individual contributor to a project, the project manager, and the IS manager. Because the individuals at the lowest level feel they are the most victimized, discussion begins with them.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR</font></b><br/>       Ideally, an individual contributor to a project should be given well-defined tasks, explicit estimates/dates, and clear guidelines on the process and deliverables. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of situations, the individual contributor is given poor task definition. Estimates and schedules are generally not explicitly stated, or they are unrealistic.<br/>    Because it is cumbersome, the corporate systems development methodology that defines the process steps and gives examples of deliverables has long since fallen in disuse. Although development center staff are probably now investigating a new methodology and tool set that will supposedly be the latest silver bullet, one would think senior management would grow suspicious of reinvesting hundreds of thousands of dollars in another methodology that is supposed to suddenly turn things around and enable IS professionals to begin to meet management's expectations.<br/>    An individual contributor proceeding under ill-defined conditions is most probably doomed to failure. Faced with a losing situation, these individuals would naturally find it difficult to give 120% to the project effort. The following five strategies aim to help the individual contributor turn a losing situation into a winning one.<br/>    Getting Agreement on Requirements. Even under the best of circumstances, where there is a detailed written specification, there is always room for misunderstanding of requirements. The first task for an individual contributor therefore is to meet with all parties to clarify their understanding of requirements. Skipping this step incurs great risk, because misunderstanding of requirements is probably the biggest reason that system projects fail to meet user expectations.<br/>    Creating a <span class="hit">Work</span> <span class="hit">Breakdown</span> <span class="hit">Structure</span>. Under ideal circumstances, which are probably the exception rather than the rule, the assigned task is at a level that requires 40 to 80 hours to complete. Regardless, however, of whether the task is estimated at 40 or 200 hours, the individual contributor should break it down into specific steps. Creating a <span class="hit">work</span> <span class="hit">breakdown</span> <span class="hit">structure</span> provides a road map of how to accomplish a task and determine the effort required to complete it.<br/>    Validating Estimates, Schedules, and Deliverables. Although in many cases, an individual is given an estimate to complete a task, there are a surprising number of instances in which no specific estimate is given. This does not mean that management does not have an expectation of how long a task should take. A person could <span class="hit">work</span> extremely hard to get a job done in two weeks only to find out a manager thought it should take just one week. So despite the person's best efforts, he or she fails to meet expectations.<br/>    This same expectation applies to the schedule and the task deliverables. Individual contributors should review and negotiate the anticipated estimate, schedule, and deliverables with the project manager to ensure that the individual's plan coincides with management expectations. This process also helps identify potential issues or problems before they happen and lets the project manager take steps to avoid a potential problem or delay by, for example, splitting a task between two individuals.<br/>    Seeking Assistance. As is true of most projects, an individual's success can be strongly influenced by others, in this case users, technical support personnel, data base administrators, operations personnel, and peers. Individual contributors should seek out these people, because their help and assistance can make the difference between success and failure.<br/>    Seeking and gaining assistance takes a great deal of art and skill. Asking too many questions can sometimes be perceived as trying to get others to do one's job. To avoid this, individuals should do research up front and make sure they use a person's time wisely.<br/>    Agreeing on Acceptance Criteria. Previously defining deliverables should give project participants a good idea of the required depth and quality of deliverables. It is still important at the end of a task, however, to have a formal review and acceptance. This very important step ensures that there are no misunderstandings down the road on what was to be delivered.<br/>    Experience indicates that the sophistication of project planning and management vary dramatically from project to project. In the vast majority of situations, they fall far short of the ideal. Using the five strategies presented here to manage client expectations helps ensure that both the individual contributor and the user win.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE PROJECT MANAGER</font></b><br/>       The title "project manager" conveys the impression that its bearers have complete mastery over their destiny. Usually, the opposite is true. It is a generally accepted principle that the project manager has all of the responsibility for a project and none of the authority over it. It is also an accepted principle that if a project goes well, the project manager gets none of the credit. If a project fails, however, the project manager gets all of the blame.<br/>    Project managers like a well-defined project with a flexible end date and access to the required resources. More typically, they receive a poorly defined project, a preestablished due date, and constrained resources. Project managers who accept this mission are typically forced to cut corners to meet the target date. Following are some typical shortcuts taken:<br/></p><blockquote>* We don't have time to talk to the<br/>users; we will give them what we<br/>think they want.<br/>* We don't have time for written<br/>specifications; we will go directly to<br/>code.<br/>* We don't have time to test; we will<br/>debug in production.<br/>* We don't have time for procedures<br/>and training; the users can learn on<br/>the job.</blockquote><p>    It is not surprising that projects conducted under such conditions are disasters. The project team typically is forced to <span class="hit">work</span> 60 to 80 hours a week to produce a poor-quality system that does not meet the needs of the business and the users. Management is typically surprised by the results.<br/>    The following strategies aim to help project managers avoid these disastrous consequences.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">FORMULATING A DETAILED PROJECT PLAN</font></b><br/>       Because projects do not come fully defined, the first job of the project manager is to plan out the project. Planning requires progressive levels of detail in the following stages.<br/>    Documenting the Management Definition. In this stage, the scope and objectives of the project are documented. Problems and issues are clearly stated, as are the features and functions included and not included. Typically, a management definition, in addition to narratives, includes high-level models including context diagrams, data/process models, and object models.<br/>    Defining the Project's Phases. Although management prefers fixed time frame and schedule on day one of the project, they are also rational people who know that project managers cannot estimate what is not defined. Accordingly, management generally recognizes the need to break the project down into some number of phases. Most methodologies have a standard set of phases for the project life cycle. The number of phases is generally a compromise between the need for precision and management tolerance in waiting for a commitment. In most cases, the project manager is asked to make order-of-magnitude estimates for the entire project based on some assumptions of project scope. These assumptions should be formally documented for later reference.<br/>    When an iterative or prototyping development approach is used, it is helpful to introduce the concept of time fences, or fixed time frames. This approach lets a project team prototype until the time fence is reached, the objective being a system that meets requirements but is not necessarily perfect.<br/>    Doing a <span class="hit">Work</span> <span class="hit">Breakdown</span> <span class="hit">Structure</span>. As is the case for an individual contributor, a project manager should break the job down into detailed tasks. The need and advantages of breaking a project phase down to 40-hour tasks is widely known but seldom practiced. This step requires a lot of <span class="hit">work</span> but it forces definition, provides a reasonable base for estimating, and subsequently provides the basis for project monitoring/control and status reporting. As a mentor once said, "If you think you are spending too much time planning, you are probably doing an adequate amount."<br/>    Reconciling Staffing and Scheduling. Once the project has been broken down into a set of tasks, the project manager needs to assign staff to the project and establish a schedule. The staffing plan should explicitly take into account planned and unplanned absence for vacation, illness, and training.<br/>    Although there is often a lot of pressure to plan on overtime at this stage, the practice should be strenuously avoided and reserved for contingency. People are not productive under continuous overtime. At this stage, project managers should ensure that they have a <span class="hit">workable</span> schedule with adequate resources. If management objects to the planned end date, the project manager should involve them in analyzing which tasks should be dropped or how the scope may be cut back. When managers start looking at such detailed tasks as walk-throughs, testing, and training, most are reasonable enough not to want to drop these important tasks. Yet when reasonable, the cutting of project scope should be aggressively pursued to reduce the exponentially increasing risk associated with project length.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">GETTING ALL PARTIES INVOLVED</font></b><br/>       To simplify task assignment and prioritization, project managers prefer that all required human resources be assigned to a project on a full-time basis. Unfortunately, the need for specialized skills elsewhere in the organization or other commitments often make this ideal situation impractical. Typically, the people that should be involved on a part-time basis throughout the systems development project include:<br/></p><blockquote>* Senior and user management.<br/>* Users.<br/>* Data administration, technical sup-<br/>port, development center, and oper-<br/>ations personnel.<br/>* Suppliers.<br/>* Auditing and quality assurance per-<br/>sonnel.<br/>* Administrative, facilities, and<br/>human resources personnel.<br/>* Customers.</blockquote><p>    In some cases, purchasing, public relations, and legal personnel will be involved, as will consultants.<br/>    Getting all of these parties involved effectively and on a timely basis is one of the primary responsibilities and critical success factors for the project manager. To do so, the project manager must first recognize that all of these people help determine project success. Because some of them may be reluctant to participate, the project manager needs to sell to each of them the positive effect of participation on their and the project's goals. Project managers also need to assess the strengths and weaknesses of these people so that their involvement can be as effective as possible. Dealing with reluctant or difficult people is not easy and requires a focused and positive approach.<br/>    Project managers can gain the required participation through the use of steering committees, facilitation sessions, and ad-hoc committees. The bottom line is that the more people feel ownership of the success of the project, the greater the chance for success.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">EMPHASIZING TEAMWORK</font></b><br/>       Every management style has its appropriate time and place. The style that <span class="hit">works</span> most successfully in project management emphasizes that the manager <span class="hit">works</span> for the team.<br/>    Using this style, the project manager <span class="hit">works</span> to provide team members with the resources and assistance they need to do their assignments, whether that be getting outside support, negotiating more time, providing assistance or mentoring, and resolving issues or problems. This style leads to open communication, in which team members feel free to come forward with issues, problems, or risks and to <span class="hit">work</span> together to resolve them.<br/>    A supportive management style necessitates that the project manager focus on giving positive reinforcement for task accomplishment and remaining open to issues that could have a negative impact on the project. If the project manager kills the messenger, communication will cease and management will have no knowledge of what is going on within the project.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">PLANNING FOR CHANGE</font></b><br/>       Contrary to many managers' opinion, most people are overly optimistic in their estimates of <span class="hit">work</span> completion. Years of experience show that people consistently underestimate the changes or problems that will occur during a project. If these factors are not planned for, they will individually and collectively affect project success.<br/>    Dealing with these uncertainties requires budgeting for change and contingencies. Management will generally accept these budgets, if there is an appropriate management process to approve changes to them.<br/>    Project managers who pursue the preceding strategies with a strong commitment almost guarantee that they will create and maintain a winning environment in which the project and the team enjoy success.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">IS MANAGERS</font></b><br/>       The turnover among IS managers is indicative of the major pressures these individuals face. The IS function's track record of delivering poor-quality projects late and over budget is causing many companies to consider alternative personnel and organizational <span class="hit">structures</span>, such as decentralizing the function. The resulting uncontrolled environment and lack of real performance improvement, however, often cause companies to recentralize or outsource the whole IS function.<br/>    Many IS managers feel that they have been set up to fail. The business executive puts unreasonable short-term demands on IS support, and management does not approve the required resources in the needed time frames. Using the following strategies will help IS managers avoid being forced into a no-win situation.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">PLANNING PROACTIVELY</font></b><br/>       To provide the needed time frames to secure resources and meet business requirements, IS managers need to proactively pursue systems planning with each of the individual business functions or business managers. Given the IS function's lack of a track record in delivering systems against a plan, business heads may initially be reluctant to commit the time and effort necessary to plan future requirements. In this case, the planning process should cover a shorter time frame (e.g., one to three months), until the IS function's credibility to deliver has been established.<br/>    After the planning process is expanded to an annual time frame, it should be directly tied to the systems budget. Using the concepts of activity-based costing or zero-based budgeting, approved projects should directly determine the budget. If upper management subsequently wants to cut budgets, they should be asked to select which projects to cut. IS managers who accept budget cuts without a matching reduction in the <span class="hit">work</span> level set up the IS function to fail.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">MANAGING SCOPE</font></b><br/>       It is a universal truth that project risks increase exponentially with project size and time frames. As projects increase in length, the potential impacts from business changes, staff changes, and lost user commitment increase. Likewise, increasing the size of the project staff greatly increases the risks of communication difficulties.<br/>    One effective way to control scope is to insist that all projects be broken down into deliverables of from 6 to 12 months. Establishing this guideline facilitates the formulation of appropriate system plans.<br/>    Delivering system functionality in a 6- to 12-month time frame not only reduces project risks, it also achieves benefits earlier. In addition, as project staff gain experience and credibility in delivering projects on time and to budget, their confidence grows. With subsequent growth in development maturity, this scope restriction can be relaxed. Even so, the benefits of phasing in project deliverables generally overshadows the potential added expense.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">ENSURING USER OWNERSHIP</font></b><br/>       Because systems projects are developed for the sole benefit of the business function, it is essential that the function assume ownership of the project. IS managers can ensure user ownership early on by having the requesting user function assume primary responsibility for making the business case for including the project in the systems plan and budget. If senior management cuts the project and budget, then it is not the IS function's fault, but rather the failure of the business unit to present a strong business case.<br/>    Once a project is approved and started, ongoing user involvement is essential to its success. IS managers can ensure that this happens by insisting on the establishment of an active steering committee chaired by the user sponsor and on the usere commitment of necessary time and resources. Without this commitment, IS managers may have to be firm and delay or cancel a project. Users should have defined roles in requirements definition, design reviews, testing, and user procedures/training. These responsibilities cannot be ignored without sacrificing the project's potential success.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">ENFORCING USE OF A METHODOLOGY</font></b><br/>       A formal systems development methodology with standardized deliverables is critical to a successful project. The methodology provides clear communication of the expected deliverables, a means to ensure consistent communication among team members, and an effective means for management to judge what has been accomplished and to understand what such things as design specification or test plan mean.<br/>    If IS managers do not enforce use of the standard methodology, documentation will quickly deteriorate. Unfortunately, the consequences of poor communication resulting from lack of written documentation generally do not surface until late in the project development or after the system is in production.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">MAINTAINING OPEN COMMUNICATIONS</font></b><br/>       To ensure that problems, issues, and risks are brought to the appropriate managerial levels, the IS manager must ensure that open communication is maintained with both user and senior management. When communication is open, issues are manageable. It is the big surprise that "the project will be delayed for six months" that management has difficulty dealing with.<br/>    By following these strategies, IS managers create an environment that helps ensure the success of their project teams and of the IS function as a whole. Building up the function's credibility helps change the image of the function from an albatross to a strategic partner key to the company's success.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">CONCLUSION</font></b><br/>       An executive steering committee can be an effective means to ensure that these management processes are established and maintained. To be effective, the steering committee must have the ultimate authority on the approval of projects, represent the entire organization, and be able to commit to meeting for at least one to two hours a month. At these meetings, each department head should report on the status of ongoing projects.<br/>    The strategies outlined in this column are designed to ensure success at each level of project involvement. If all the parties at all levels use these strategies, they will establish an extremely powerful and effective environment that helps ensure that the system development process meets the needs of the business in a reliable and cost-effective manner.<br/>    Added material<br/>    DANIEL W.
