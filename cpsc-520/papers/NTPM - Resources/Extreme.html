The goal seemed to be to port existing mainframe capabilities to a client/server environment, but no one seemed to know why. "Nobody had really challenged the business to say, 'Why are you doing this?'" recalls Hawrysh, an independent consultant in Plymouth, Minn.<br/>    Using <span class="hit">extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> tools, he forced the business unit people to figure out what they really wanted and to realize that they didn't have the time or resources to do it. The <span class="hit">project</span> was canceled.<br/>    "That was a success," he says, "because I saved them $450,000."<br/>    "Most <span class="hit">projects</span> that fail, fail before they start," says Rob Thomsett, a senior consultant at Cutter Consortium in Arlington, Mass. Thomsett is a leading proponent of <span class="hit">extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> and author of Radical <span class="hit">Project</span> <span class="hit">Management</span> (Prentice Hall PTR, 2002). Studies such as "The Chaos Chronicles" by The Standish Group International Inc. in West Yarmouth, Mass., show that IT <span class="hit">projects</span> fail because of lack of stakeholder involvement, incomplete requirements, lack of sponsor support or unrealistic expectations -- in a phrase: lack of commitment from your business customers.<br/>    <span class="hit">Extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is a new approach that's relatively unknown in the U.S. It requires the <span class="hit">project</span> manager to leave the technology to the tech team and concentrate his energies on managing critical stakeholders. It grew out of the <span class="hit">extreme</span> programming movement of the mid-'90s, a radical version of rapid application development that emphasizes IT/business teamwork to provide enhanced customer satisfaction. (For more on <span class="hit">extreme</span> programming, go to <a href="javascript: void 0;" onclick="openWin('http://www.extremeprogramming.org');">www.extremeprogramming.org.</a>)<br/>    "It's called '<span class="hit">extreme</span>' because it goes against common practice and is suited to <span class="hit">projects</span> being done in chaotic environments under severe constraints," says Thomsett, who does most of his work in Australia for companies such as A.M.P. Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp., both in Sydney. "It's like <span class="hit">extreme</span> sports in that you have to be really proficient to do it."<br/>    Thomsett has developed a set of tools that are paper-based exercises designed to get stakeholders engaged. <span class="hit">Project</span> managers who have used the tools swear by them. "This process makes sure you're adding value to the company," Hawrysh says. "It makes you think about why we're doing it."<br/>    "In a traditional <span class="hit">project</span>, if it's not going to be done on time, someone has to break the news to executives," says Christine Moore, vice president of delivery services at Caribou Lake Software LLC, a Minneapolis firm that does custom software development. "Here, there's no news to break. If you're <span class="hit">extreme</span>, everyone is in it daily."<br/>    The following are four <span class="hit">extreme</span> tools that you can try. <span class="hit">Project</span> managers say that these tools, if used diligently and within the context of a so-called Rapid <span class="hit">Project</span> Planning session [QuickLink: 31177], virtually guarantee that your business clients will take charge of the <span class="hit">project</span>.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">TOOL 1 SLIDERS: WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE</font></b><br/>    Traditionally, <span class="hit">projects</span> are deemed successful if they're on time and on budget, but any business person stuck with a new system that doesn't add value can tell you there's more to success than that. "The Holy Grail is not modeling requirements, it's modeling expectations," says Thomsett.<br/>    This exercise requires critical stakeholders to draw a detailed picture of what <span class="hit">project</span> success will look like, using "sliders" that can be turned all the way on (Level 5) all the way off (Level 1) or anywhere in between, depending on how important each of seven criteria is to the <span class="hit">project</span>'s success (see illustration, next page) "This determines everything," says Thomsett.<br/>    <span class="hit">Project</span> managers say sliders help them understand whom they're dealing with. Stakeholders in a financial system, for example, may turn up the budget slider but not care as much about deadlines. Stakeholders in a Web-based customer-facing <span class="hit">project</span> may place more emphasis on quality.<br/>    Sliders graphically demonstrate that when resources are limited, something has to give. "The tool forces [stakeholders] to face their own expectations," says Brian Walden, a program manager at AMP (U.K.) Financial Services Ltd. in Peterborough, Australia, who has used <span class="hit">extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> extensively.<br/>    James Peterson (not his real name), is an IT <span class="hit">project</span> manager at a large U.K. bank who asked to remain anonymous because his company is publicity-shy. The first time he used sliders, nearly everybody turned all of them all the way on for a <span class="hit">project</span> with limited funds and a tight deadline. Then one business analyst got it: "Look," he said. "You can't buy a Rolls Royce for $10,000; you buy a really good used Toyota that will get you from A to B."<br/>    Suddenly, everybody understood the tool, Peterson says. "Budget and time became fully switched on, value to the organization received a 4, quality received a 2, satisfied customers 3, and the group accepted that they won't get too much personal satisfaction out of the <span class="hit">project</span> because most of them wanted the Rolls Royce," he says.<br/>    Sliders also do away with many surprises. "There will be no death march without knowing in advance because they say upfront how important team satisfaction is," Thomsett explains.<br/>    Most important, sliders facilitate communication and expose hidden agendas because stakeholders have to agree on slider placement. "If you can't get an agreement from critical stakeholders, walk away," Thomsett says.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">TOOL 2 IS/IS NOT: SCOPE PLANNING</font></b><br/>    "A circle is defined by what is outside as well as what is inside," Thomsett says. The same goes for your <span class="hit">project</span>. The key to scoping is to get your stakeholders to define not only what is within the scope of the <span class="hit">project</span>, but also what isn't (see illustration).<br/>    Stakeholders are asked to name things that are inside and outside the <span class="hit">project</span> scope. For example, if your team will be creating new pages for a Web site, then "creating new pages" would go under "is." But if the team won't be enhancing current pages, that goes under "is not."<br/>    Continue this as long as you can, Thomsett advises. "The further down you go, the clearer it becomes," he says.<br/>    "It gets people thinking," says Hawrysh. "It really helps identify what this thing is you're working on."<br/>    "People think they know what the <span class="hit">project</span> is, but you find that no one is really on the same page," says Moore.<br/>    As <span class="hit">project</span> manager, whether an objective is inside or outside the scope is not your concern. The executive sponsor "owns" the <span class="hit">project</span>; you merely facilitate. "Let them fight over it," Thomsett says. If there's anything that stakeholders can't agree on, it goes to the executive sponsor for resolution.<br/>    In the end, everything outside the scope either is assigned to a stakeholder, becomes a different <span class="hit">project</span> or simply won't be done.<br/>    "<span class="hit">Projects</span> are defined more clearly. It brings out the queries much earlier," Walden says. In fact, he says, <span class="hit">projects</span> are often canceled when the "is/is not" session makes stakeholders realize that they're not prepared to pay for the full scope.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">TOOL 3 STAKEHOLDER AGREEMENT</font></b><br/>    Everything that is not within the <span class="hit">project</span> scope, but is essential for the <span class="hit">project</span> (such as outsourced programming), is assigned to a stakeholder, who completes and signs a stakeholder agreement.<br/>    In traditional <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span>, stakeholders are expected to take on responsibilities, but there's no accountability, Thomsett says. For example, if a subtask is to be outsourced and the stakeholder doesn't get around to it, the <span class="hit">project</span> team may end up doing the task by default, expanding scope and increasing risk without any recognition that it's doing so. To avoid this, it's essential to formally analyze, negotiate and agree in writing with each critical stakeholder on the services that are expected, the dates or timing of services, cost to the stakeholder of providing the service, and an alternate source for obtaining the service.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">TOOL 4 THE QUALITY AGREEMENT</font></b><br/>    What level of quality is required? The quality agreement lists 10 attributes for the <span class="hit">project</span>. The stakeholders must agree on which are essential. The <span class="hit">project</span> manager doesn't care which attributes the stakeholders choose. He merely informs them that for every attribute required, both the risk and cost go up.<br/>    The quality agreement sets the baseline for all <span class="hit">project</span> quality assurance going forward.<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">NOT FOR WIMPS</font></b><br/>    <span class="hit">Extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> isn't for everyone. It takes <span class="hit">project</span> managers with the courage and executive backing to make the stakeholders toe the line, and it takes business people willing -- or compelled by senior executives -- to commit real elbow grease to a <span class="hit">project</span>. But the payback is worth it, say <span class="hit">project</span> managers.<br/>    "The tools help the customer feel involved and part of the team," says Moore. "The <span class="hit">project</span> is not something that happened to them; it's something they're a part of, and when that happens, everything is easier."<br/>ADDED MATERIAL<br/>    FRANKLIN HAMMOND<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">A SAMPLING OF THE TOOLS</font></b><br/>    SLIDERS: In this <span class="hit">project</span>, budget and satisfaction are expendable.

The inner circle represents the <span class="hit">project</span> content -- the technical deliverables. The outer circle represents context -- the managerial and sociopolitical environment. Traditional <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> is focused inward, he says, but <span class="hit">extreme</span> <span class="hit">project</span> <span class="hit">management</span> focuses outward.<br/>    The bigger the <span class="hit">project</span>, the more time the <span class="hit">project</span> manager needs to spend on context. In big <span class="hit">projects</span>, <span class="hit">project</span> managers should be spending 70% to 80% of their time "doing lattes" with stakeholders, he says. That means schmoozing, politicking, keeping them in the loop, keeping up their interest and commitment, getting their input. Remember, says Thomsett, it's their <span class="hit">project</span>. As <span class="hit">project</span> manager, you are merely the "passive conduit of their hopes and dreams."<br/>    "These things are easy to say, but in practice very hard to do," says Christine Moore, vice president of delivery services at Caribou Lake Software. "<span class="hit">Project</span> managers used to assign tasks; now you have to work on relationships with people and keep them involved and committed. The customer may say, 'I can't be there that day.' People may lose commitment. Your role really is running around 'doing lattes.'"<br/>    --Kathleen Melymuka<br/></p><p><b><font size="-1">THE RAPP SESSION</font></b><br/>    The Rapid <span class="hit">Project</span> Planning (RAPP) session sets the <span class="hit">project</span>'s tone and gets decisions made.<br/>    QuickLink: 31177<br/>    <a href="javascript: void 0;" onclick="openWin('http://www.computerworld.com');">www.computerworld.com</a><br/></p>
