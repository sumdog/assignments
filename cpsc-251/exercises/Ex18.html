	<li class="question"><b>16.7</b> Name servers are organized in a hierarchical manner. What is the purpose of using a hierarchical organization?</li>
	  <ul>
		<li class="answer">A hierarchical structure is used due to the way that the name servers are contacted. For instance if the name bob.cs.utc.edu was requested the kernel of the system would issue a request to the name server for the edu domain, asking for the address of the name server for utc.edu. The name server for the edu domain must be at a known address, so that it can be queried. Then the edu name server returns the address of the host on which the utc.edu name server resides. The kernel on the system the queries the name server at this address and asks about cs.utc.edu. Then an address is returns; and a request to that address for bob.cs.utc.edu now returns an Internet address host-id for that host.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class="question"><b>16.12</b> Consider a distributed system with two sites, A and B. Consider whether site A can distinguish among the following:
		<ul>
			<li class="question"><b>a</b> B goes down.</li>
			<li class="question"><b>b</b> The link between A and B goes down.</li>
			<li class="question"><b>c</b> B is extremely overloaded and its response time is 100 times longer than normal.</li>
		</ul>
	  <ul>
		<li class="answer">A can not distinguish between B going down and the link going down unless there is an alternative form of communication between A and B. Many companies that need to insure redundancy use backups such as ISDN/BRI and in such cases, A would be able to determine if B is down or if the link is just down. If B is overloaded, A will still be able to tell that B is up because B would still respond to A's requests, they would just be heavily delayed.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li class="question"><b>16.14</b> What use is an address-resolution protocol? Why is it better to use such a protocol than to make each host read each packet to determine that packetâ€™s destination? Does a token-passing network need such a protocol? Explain your answer.</li>
	  <ul>
		<li class="answer">  If a system needs to send data to another system withing a network, the kernel generates an address resolution protocol pack containing the IP address of the destination system. That packet is then distrubuted throughout the network.</li>

          <li>The ARP protocol is more efficient than having each host read each packet individually. Only the the system whose IP address matches the IP address fo the ARP request responds and sends back its medium access control address.</li>

          <li>A token passing network would not need an ARP because the tokens are continuously circulating throughout the system. Adding new sites to a token passing network is less likely to cause a large performance decrease than on an Ethernet network.</li>
