<P class=question><B>7.4</B> Compare the circular-wait scheme with the 
deadlock-avoidance schemes (like the banker’s algorithm) with respect to the 
following issues: <BR>a)Runtime Overheads<BR>b)System Throughput </P>
<P class=answer>Answer: <BR>- Runtime overheads tend to increase with the use of 
deadlock-avoidance schemes because they have to keep up with several data 
structures in order to do their job. <BR>- System throughput can be reduced when 
using the circular-wait scheme because it does not allow for as many resouses to 
be used concurrently like the banker's algorithm. </P>
<P class=question><B>7.5</B> In a real computer system, neither the resources 
available nor the demands of processes for resources are consistent over long 
periods (months). Resources break or are replaced, new processes come and go, 
new resources are bought and added to the system. If deadlock is controlled by 
the banker’s algorithm, which of the following changes can be made safely 
(without introducing the possibility of deadlock), and underwhat 
circumstances?</P>
<P class=question>a) Increase Available (new resources added).<BR>b) Decrease 
Available (resource permanently removed from system)<BR>c) Increase Max for one 
process (the process needs more resources than allowed, it may want more)<BR>d) 
Decrease Max for one process (the process decides it does not need that many 
resources)<BR>e) Increase the number of processes.<BR>f) Decrease the number of 
processes.</P>
<P class=answer>Answer: <BR>a) Increase Available (new resources added). - This 
is always safe. <BR>b) Decrease Available (resource permanently removed from 
system) - This is only safe if in decreasing the resources does not make Max 
exceed the available resources.<BR>c) Increase Max for one process (the process 
needs more resources than allowed, it may want more) - This is only safe if Max 
does not increase above the amount of available resources.<BR>d) Decrease Max 
for one process (the process decides it does not need that many resources) - 
This is always safe.<BR>e) Increase the number of processes. - This is always 
safe.<BR>f) Decrease the number of processes. - This is always 
safe.<BR></P></BODY></HTML>
