\section{Phase 1}
\paragraph{}I started to write a set of functions that would queue packets, however none of my packets would deliver. I then realized we wern't suposte to queue packets but acks. My Linux account in the labs was then suspended and when I asked Srini if I could have access to the lab to work on cnet, he told me to turn in what I have. Since this program is late and I have no modivation to work on it at home, I am going to turn it in as is.

\section{Phase 2}Not implemented.
