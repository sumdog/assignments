Included in this file are three C# source files located in ./src and a Makefile to compile them in Linux under mono. They will also compile and run fine under Microsoft Visual Studio .NET

The test.sh script is provided to help automate running the individual tests. It takes one argument that must be either "cars" or "soy" Just in case, I also provided you with the binary and two .out files from the test script. If you have any problems with it, please email me.
