CPSC-532r - Homework #2 - Sumit Khanna

This is a simply program written for Dr. Harris's CPSC-532r
class. It reads from standard in and counts the number
of bytes, words and new line characters.

It has an internal mechnism for string parsing as well
as the ability to use the 'wc' program as a backend.


**CONFIG**
To configure:
./configure

To configure with wc as backend:
./configure --with-wc


**COMPILE**
To compile:
make

Alternative way to compile (-DHAVE_WC is optional):
gcc src/*.c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DHAVE_WC


**RUN/TEST**
To run:
cd src
./cpsc538hw2

To use file redirection:
cd src
./cpsc538hw2 < /path/to/some/file


**INSTALL**
install? You're kidding right? In theory you should be
able to do a 'make install' and have it installed
to /usr/local/bin, but why would you want to?
