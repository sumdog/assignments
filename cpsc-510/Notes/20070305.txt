Control Structure
	* A control structure is a control statement and the statements whose execution it controls
	* Design question: should a control structure have multiple entries? (goto)
Fortran I
	* Arithmetic IF was a 3-way selector
		...
	* General Form:
		if control_expression
			then clause
			else clause
	* Design Issues:
		* What is the form and type of the control expression?
		* How are the then and else clauses specified?
		* How should the meaning of nested selectors be specified? 
Cobol (two way selector):
	* General form
		IF condition
			(statement {statement}| [NEXT SENTENCE])
			[ELSE (statement {statement} | [NEXT SENTENCE]]
	* Example
		IF HOURS > 40
			PERFORM OVERTIME-PAY
		ELSE
			PERFORM REGULAR-PAY
	* "if" not required in Cobol. It could be left out as long as else is down there
Fortran (two way selector)
	* IF(boolean_expr) statement
	* Problem: can select only a single statement; to select more, a GOTO must be used as in the following example
		IF (.NOT. condition) GOTO 20
			...
		20 CONTINUE
	* Negative logic is bad for readability 
	* This problem was solved in FORTRAN 77
	* Most later languages allow compounds for the selectable segment of their single-way selectors
Algol (two way selector):
	* ALGOL 60
		if (boolean_expr)
			then statement (then clause)
			else statement (else clause)
