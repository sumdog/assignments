RIP - A distance vector protocol with a maximum cost path of 15 (with each link being 1), limiting the use of RIP to autonomous systems that are fewer than 15 hops in diameter. Updates are done between neighbors approximately every 30 seconds. (p 346)

OSPF: Open Shortest Path First - Link State Protocol that uses flooding of link state information and a Dijkstra least-cost path algorithm. (p 350)

BGP: Border Gateway Protocol - de facto standard inter-domain routing protocol in today's Internet. It's a path vector protocol that exchanges detailed path information between neighboring routers.


IPv4 - IPv6 - The current version of IP used in todays networks is IPv4. IPv4 consists of four numbers in base 256 separated by periods (e.g. 149.149.30.18). IPv4 is limited by the fact that the allocation space for IP numbers is only 32-bits long. Because of this, we are quickly running out of IP addresses for the ever growing Internet. Also, certain ranges are reserved in IPv4 (192.168.x.x and 10.x.x.x) for private network IP addresses. The successor to IPv4 is IPv6. IPv6 uses a 128-bit space for allocating numbers allowing for a much larger space from which to allocate numbers. IPv6 also supports placing certain priority on packets and routing based on Quality of Service. The disadvantages of IPv6 is that the current layer of TCP can't utilize all the IPv6 functionality. Also, there is no slated "conversion date" when everyone will switch over (Japan has officially announced that IPv6 must be fully implement by 2006 on their networks). IPv6 address also look nothing like IPv4 addresses (numbers are in base 16/Hex).
